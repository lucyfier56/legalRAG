erstwhile Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), however, due to the 
enactment of the  Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021, the petitions have been 
placed before this Court. 
2. Notice in the aforesaid rectification petitions was  issued by the IPAB 
on 8th February, 2019. Counter statements thereto have been filed on behalf 
of the respondent  no.1 and rejoinder has been filed on behalf of the 
petitioner company. 
3. Since all the three petitions raise similar issues, they are being decided 
by way of a common judgment. 
BRIEF FACTS 
4. Briefly, the case set up by the petitioner company is as under: 
4.1 The pe titioner company, incorporated in Japan , is an automotive 
manufacturer and operates throughout the world.  The vehicles of the 
petitioner company are sold in more than 170 countries and the 
petitioner company conducts business worldwide with 53 overseas 
manufacturing companies in 28 countries and regions.  
4.2 The petitioner company entered the Indian market in a joint venture 
with the Kirloskar Gr oup in 1997 known as Toyota Kirloskar Motor 
Pvt. Ltd. and set up manufacturing facilities in India.   
4.3 The petitioner company owns various distinctive and well -known 
trademarks, one of which include s the trade mark „ALPHARD‟. The

the year 2002.

„ALPHARD‟ has not yet been form ally launched in India, the same 
has been available in the country for the last many years on account of 
direct import s by Indian residen ts. The earliest registration of the 
petitioner company‟s mark „ALPHARD‟ dates back to 1986 and the 
said trade  mark is registered in various jurisdictions, such as Japan, 
China, Singapore etc.   
4.5 The petitioner company has sold more than 8,50,000 units under the 
trade mark „ALPHARD‟ since its launch in 2002.  The details of sales 
figures as well as advertising and promotional expenses incurred by 
the petitioner company from 2002 -2017 ha ve been given in the 
petition. 
4.6 The petitioner  company‟s trade  mark „ALPHARD‟ is well -known 
throughout the world and ha s acquired a secondary meaning with the 
people associated with the trade associating the same with the 
petitioner. 
4.7 The petitioner company applied for registration of the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ on a „ proposed to be used basis ‟ on 21st November, 
2017 and the same has been objected to by the Registry.  
4.8 The respondent no.1 obtained registration of the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ under Classes 9, 12 and 27 on 5th November, 2015 on a 
„proposed to be used basis‟. 
4.9 Adoption of the petitioner  company‟s trade  mark by the respondent 
no.1 in relation to goods in the allied/cognate field has been done in a 
mala fide  manner so as to trade upon the  petitioner company‟s 
goodwill and reputation.

summarized as under: 
5.1 Respondent no.1 is the prior user and bona fide adopter of the trade  
mark „ALPHARD‟ for goods under Class es 9, 12 and 27 since the 
year 2015. 
5.2 The respondent no.1 coined and adopted the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
in the year 2015 and since its adoption , the respondent no.1 has been 
continuously and extensively using the said trade mark. 
5.3 The aforesaid trade mark has been used by the respo ndent no.1 along 
with its sister companies, „Tekstar Global Private Limited ‟ and „Sai 
Supertrek Global Private Limited‟.    
5.4 Though the petitioner company applied for the registration of its trade 
mark „ALPHARD in Class 12 , it is an admitted position that t he 
petitioner company has not used the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in India. 
5.5 In light of the non -user by the petitioner  Company, there cannot be 
any goodwill or transborder reputation in respect of the aforesaid 
trade mark in India.   
5.6 The petitioner company has made contradictory claims in its petition.  
On one hand, the petitioner company claims that the petitioner ‟s 
vehicles under the aforesaid trade mark were available in India from 
the year 2008 , on the other hand, the trade mark  registration 
application has b een filed by the petitioner company on a „ proposed 
to be used basis‟ in November, 2017.

6.1 Vehicles bearing the petitioner  company‟s trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
have been sold in India as far back as 2008.  Reliance is placed on 
printouts from third -party websites showing listings of the petitioner  
company‟s vehicles in India for sale. 
6.2 Petitioner company‟s trade mark „ALPHARD‟ enjoys a world wide 
reputation and the same has a direct spillover in India. In this regard, 
petitioner company has placed on record international 
brochures/annual reports, awards, worldwide trade mark registration 
certificates/renewal certificates and promotional material in respect of 
the mark „ALPHARD‟.  
6.3 The invoices placed on record on behalf of the respondent no.1 are 
not of the respondent no.1  company but of „ Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟.   
6.4 Registration could not have been granted to the respondent no.1  in 
terms of Sections 11(1), 11(2), 11(3) and 11(10) of the Trade Marks 
Act, 1999 (hereinafter „the Act‟).   
6.5 Reliance is placed on the judgment of a Division Bench of this Court 
in MAC Personal Care Pvt. Ltd. v. Laverana GMBH and Co. , 2016

trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in  India in  any of the three classes  viz., 
Class 9, Class 12 and Class 27, where the mark has been registered in 
favour of the respondent no.1. Further, the trade mar k „ALPHARD‟ 
has not been used by the petitioner company in Classes 9 or 27 even 
outside India. 
7.2 The products of the respondent no.1 have been continuously sold 
under the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ since the year 2015.  Reliance in 
this regard is placed on the inv oices of „Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟, sister company of the respondent no.1.   
7.3 The word „ALPHARD‟ is the name of a star and therefore, the same 
has been adopted by the respondent no.1 in a bona fide manner.  Its 
use in relation to car accessories is completely arbitrary and fanciful.  
7.4 The provisions of Section s 11(1), 11(2) and 11(3) of the Act have no 
application in the present case as there is no earlier registered trade 
mark in the present case.   
7.5 Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Co urt in Toyota 
Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha v. Prius Auto Industries Ltd. , (2018) 2 
SCC 1 and the order of IPAB in Hypnos Limited v. Hosur Coir 
Foam Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. , 2015 SCC OnLine IPAB 213 , to contend 
that in the present case , there is no transnational rep utation available 
to the petitioner company in India.  
ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS  
8. I have heard the counsel for the parties and perused the record.

for determining transnational reputation. It was the case of Toyota that the 
car under the brand  „Prius‟ was launched in Japan in 1997 and in other 
countries in 2000 -2001. However, „Prius‟ was released in India in the year 
2009 and formally launched in the year 2010.  The respondent (defendant in 
the suit), had got the mark „Prius‟ registered in India in 2002  in respect of 
auto parts and accessories  and was using the said mark in India since 2001. 
A suit for  infringement of the mark „Prius‟ and  passing off was filed by 
Toyota against the respondent. After a full trial, a Single Judge of this Court 
held that the acts of the respondent amounted to passing off of the 
respondent‟s goods under the trade name „Prius‟ and consequently granted a 
permanent injunction in favour of the plaintiff . In appeal, the Division 
Bench reversed the judgment of the Single Judge and declined the relief of 
permanent injunction. This was challenged by Toyota before the Supreme 
Court.  
10. Relying upon the judgments of the Courts in the U.K. and Australia 
and the passages from the book „ The Law of Passing -Off‟ by Prof. 
Christopher Wadlow, the Supreme Court applied the „territoriality 
principle‟ and held that the transnational reputation of Toyota in respect of 
the trade mark 'Prius‟ has not spilled over to India and hence, did not grant 
permanent injunction in favour of Toyota . The relevant observations of the 
Supreme Court with regard to the application of the „territoriality principle‟ 
are set out below: 
“32.  Prof. Cristopher Wadlow's view on the subject appears to 
be that the test of whether a foreign claimant may succeed in a 
passing-off action is whether his business has a goodwill in a 
particular jurisdiction, which criterion is broader than the 
“obsolete” t est of whether a claimant has a business/place of

business in that jurisdiction. If there are customers for the 
claimant's products in that jurisdiction, then the claimant stands 
in the same position as a domestic trader. 
 
33.  The overwhelming judicial and academic opinion all over 
the globe, therefore, seems to be in favour of the territoriality 
principle. We do not see why the same should not apply to this 
country. 
 
34.  To give effect to the territoriality principle, the courts 
must necessarily have to determine if there has been a spillover 
of the reputation and goodwill of the mark used by the claimant 
who has brought the passing -off action. In the course of such 
determination it may be necessary to seek and ascertain the 
existence of not necessarily a  real market but the presence of 
the claimant through its mark within a particular territorial 
jurisdiction in a more subtle form which can best be manifested 
by the following illustrations, though they arise from decisions of 
courts which may not be final in that particular jurisdiction.” 
 
11. Applying the aforesaid principle s to the facts of the case before the 
Supreme Court in Toyota (supra), it was observed as under: 
(i) Undoubtedly, t he trade mark „Prius‟ has acquired a great deal of 
goodwill in various other jurisdictions in the world before  its use and 
registration by the respondent in India. 
(ii) Merely on account of advertisements in automobile magazines, 
international business magazines and information on the internet, it 
cannot be said that the aforesaid produ ct has acquired the necessary 
goodwill and reputation in the Indian market. 
(iii) The evidence on record also showed very limited sale s of the product 
in the Indian market and no advertisement prior to the registration by 
the defendant.

(iv) The plaintiff failed to f urnish sufficient proof of knowledge and 
information about the product in India. 
(v) The brand name of the car „Prius‟ had not acquired the degree of 
goodwill, reputation and popularity in the Indian market so as to 
create a right of prior user in favour of To yota against a registered 
owner. 
12.  To a similar effect is the order of the IPAB in Hypnos Limited  
(supra).  In the said case, the applicant was the registered proprietor of the 
mark „Hypnos‟, adopted several decades ago in relation to beds , mattresses, 
pillows, etc.  It was also the case of the applicant that beds bearing the trade 
mark „Hypnos‟ had been supplied by the applicant to hotels in India in the 
years 2008 to 2010.  The respondent‟s trade mark was registered in Class 20 
in the year 2007. It was the  case of the applicant that the respondent had 
dishonestly adopted and obtained registration of the trade mark „Hypnos‟ in 
India and started using the same for selling similar goods. Rejecting the 
submission of the applicant that the impugned trade mark „H ypnos‟ is a 
„well-known trademark‟ and carries transborder reputation , which has 
spilled over to India, the IPAB dismissed the rectification petition. The 
relevant observations are as under: 
“81.  We agree with the proposition propounded in the 
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court on same issue, wherein the 
Hon'ble Apex court has held that in the case of  National Sewing 
Thread Co. Ltd. v. James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd. (Supra). 
 
“Wherein the Hon'ble court has taken view that “the suit of 
passing-off and the oppos ition proceedings pending before 
the Registrar of Trademarks are different from each other”. 
 
82.  We are also of the same opinion as this proposition lay

down in above judgment that the rectification proceeding under 
section 57 of the trademarks Act is al so altogether quite 
different from the suit of passing off or of opposition 
proceedings before the Registrar . The rectification proceedings 
before the board under section 57 of the trademarks Act cannot 
be equated to be similar with as in the case of passi ng off action, 
where the burden rests on the plaintiff to prove whether there is 
likelihood of the defendant's goods being passed off as the goods 
of the plaintiff but in rectification proceedings under section 57 
of the trademarks Act it deals with the po wer to cancel or vary 
registration on many grounds and to expunge the trademark from 
the register is based on different tenets altogether not as in the 
case suit for passing off, as such the rectification application also 
has inherent different structure in totality than the suit of passing 
off. 
 
83.  To claim Trans -border reputation for a mark in India, 
the impugned trademark ‘Hypnos’ must be well known 
substantial segment of consumers in India must know about the 
existence of the mark of the foreign entit y. Such knowledge 
may come from free availability of the product to Indian 
consumers or extensive advertising, which reaches a 
substantial segment of Indian consumers because of extensive 
circulation of those advertisements in India. 
 
84.  After going thro ugh the pleading and rival contention 
of the parties. We have observed that even assuming the 
applicant's trademark acquired reputation in foreign countries, 
where their trade mark is registered, but no presumption can be 
drawn at this juncture that trade mark of the applicant 
registered in foreign countries has automatically acquired 
reputation in India or trans -border reputation is percolated in 
India, as we have already pointed out that no document of the 
applicant shows of its extensive usage of the mar k in India or 
any other place of registration. 
 
85.  The applicant has failed to establish that indeed the 
applicant has trans -border reputation due to its long and

extensive use of the impugned trademark in question and the 
impugned trademark „Hypnos‟ is well known. The applicant has 
further failed to establish that the trademark “Hypnos” has 
attained the reputation and goodwill which has spilled over in to 
other countries and India. The substantial segments of consumers 
in India know about the existence o f the mark „Hypnos‟ as of the 
foreign entity. 
 
86.  It is well settled proposition that the onus is on the 
applicant applying rectification to establish by letting his 
evidence about the trans -border reputation, so the burden is on 
the applicant herein, th e applicant has to discharge his burden 
by showing extensive use and making out strong ground for 
rectification. The applicant applying for rectification application 
has to discharge its onus in removing of registered trademark 
from register. 
 
xxx     xxx              xxx 
 
88. We have also gone through the authorities submitted by the 
respondent in  support of his contention. We agree with 
propounded proposition in the above citations  that the onus is 
on the applicant to discharge by producing substantial evidence 
in his  support and it is burden on the applicant to establish 
evidence of extensive, long use  of its mark and show the well 
knownness, trans -border reputation and making out  strong 
ground for rectification.” 
 
13. In light of the principle s laid down in the aforesaid judgments, it has 
to be examined whether in the present case , the petitioner  company has 
produced sufficient evidence on record in support of its contention that the 
trade mark „ALPHARD‟  carries a transborder reputation that has spilled 
over in India.   
14. Merely, the international usage of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ by the 
petitioner company is not sufficient to prove the spillover of its transnational

reputation in India.  In the present case, the petitioner company has failed to 
place on record a single invoice to show that it has sold any car under the 
brand „ALPHARD‟ in India. In fact, the trade mark application filed on 
behalf of the petitioner company in November, 2017 was on a „proposed to 
be used basis ‟. It is petitioner  company‟s own case that the same model of 
the car has been launched in India under a different brand name, „Vellfire‟.  
15. It is also an admitted position that the petitioner company has not 
advertised the said brand in India in any manner. Various documents placed 
on record by the petitioner company such as, international brochures/annual 
reports, awards, worldwide trade mark registration certificates/renewal 
certificates and promotional material, are in relation to international usage of 
the aforesaid trade mark. Undoubtedly, these documents show that the trade 
mark „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and reputation in several other 
jurisdictions around the world. However, as per the „territoriality principle‟, 
the onus is on the petitioner company to show that the trade  mark 
„ALPHARD‟ had acquired sufficient goodwill and reputation in the Indian 
market also. None of the aforesaid documents filed by the petitioner 
company show s that the brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and 
reputation in India. The documents filed by the petitioner company relating 
to India are screenshots from third-party websites showing that a few cars of 
the petitioner company under the brand „ALPHARD‟ have been listed for 
sale in India. As per the import -export data of India filed on behalf of the 
petitioner company, only fifteen import shipment record s have been found  
under the brand „ALPHARD‟ between the years 2014 to 2016  and not all of 
them are in respect of vehicles . It may be noted that the aforesaid imports 
have not been made by the petitioner company itself but by private parties.

in India . However, most of these articles are after the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ had already been registered by the respondent no.1 in India. It 
is also to be noted that the vehicle under the brand „ALPHARD‟ was never 
launched in India. The same model was launched in India in February, 2020 
under the brand „Vellfire‟. Therefore, no reliance can be placed on these 
articles to show that the brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and 
reputation in India.  
17. In Toyota (supra), the „Prius‟ model had been introduced by Toyota in 
the India n market in 2009 -2010 and there were advertisements in 
automobile magazines. Despite this, taking note of limited sale s of the 
product in India and the absence of any advertisement of the product in India 
prior to 2001, the Supreme Court held that the trad e mark „Prius‟ cannot be 
said to have acquired goodwill and reputation in the Indian market. The 
present case stands on a worse footing for the petitioner company, as in the 
present case the petitioner company has neither launched the model under 
the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in India nor has advertised the same.  
18. Counsel for the petitioner company has placed reliance on the 
judgments in MAC Personal Care  (supra) and Keller Williams Realty 
(supra) in support of his submission that the transborder reputation in respect 
of a trade mark may have a spillover reputation in India as well, despite the 
aforesaid brand not having a commercial use in India. In MAC Personal 
Care (supra), the D ivision Bench enlisted the principles for determining 
international reputation. Ho wever, the issue of spillover of transnational

reputation in India was not before the Division Bench. These principles were 
laid down by the S upreme Court subsequently in Toyota (supra). Both the 
aforesaid judgments were in the context of passing off actio n and not in the 
context of rectification petitions. To be noted that in Keller Williams Realty 
(supra), the Co -ordinate Bench of this Court denied the relief of interim 
injunction in a passing of f action. One of the reasons for denial of interim 
injunction was that the plaintiff therein had been unable to show spillover of 
its reputation a nd goodwill in India. Therefore, the reliance place d by the 
petitioner company on the aforesaid judgments is misplaced.  
19. As regards the contention of the petitioner company that the adoption 
of the mark „ALPHARD‟  by the respondent no.1 is mala fide, counsel for 
the respondent no.1 has drawn  the attention of the Court to the dictionary 
meaning of the word „Alphard‟1.  The word „Alphard‟ has been described in 
the following manner: 
“an orange star of the second magnitude that is the brightest star 
in the constellation Hydra 
Hydra is actually the largest constellation. Despite its size, it has 
only one bright star named  Alphard. It can be found over in the 
southwest sky all by itself—hence the name, which in Arabic 
means "the solitary one.” 
 
20. Except for making a bald averment, the petitioner company has failed 
to place any material on record to show that the adoption by the respondent 
no.1 was mala fide. Therefore, on the basis o f evidence on record, it cannot 
be held that the adoption of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟  by the respondent 
no.1 was mala fide or in bad faith.

21. Reliance has been placed by the petitioner company on Section 11(1), 
11(2) and 11(3) of the Act to contend that the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
should not have been granted registration in favour of the respondent  no.1 
on account of its identity and similarity with an “ earlier trade mark ”. To 
appreciate this submission, a reference may be made to the relevant 
provisions of Section 11 of the Act, which is set out as under: 
“11. Relative grounds for refusal of registration. — (1) Save as 
provided in section 12, a trade mark shall not be registered if, 
because of— 
 
(a)  its identity with an earlier trade mark  and similarity of 
goods or services covered by the trade mark; or 
 
(b)  its similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or 
similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade mark,  
 
there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, 
which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade 
mark. 
 
(2)  A trade mark which— 
 
(a)  is identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark; and 
 
(b)  is to be registered for goods or serv ices which are not 
similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered in 
the name of a different proprietor,  
 
shall not be registered, if or to the extent, the earlier trade mark 
is a well-known trade mark in India and the use of the later ma rk 
without due cause would take unfair advantage of or be 
detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier 
trade mark.

that, its use in India is liable to be prevented— 
 
(a)  by virtue of any law in particular the law of passing off 
protecting an unregistered trade mark used in the course of 
trade; or 
 
(b)  by virtue of law of copyright. 
 
(4)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the registration of a 
trade mark where the proprietor of the earlier trade mark  or 
other earlier right consents to the registration, and in such case 
the Registrar may register the mark under special circumstances 
under section 12.  
 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, earlier trade 
mark means— 
 
(a)  a registered trade mark  or an application under Section 
18 bearing an earlier date of filing or an international 
registration referred to in Section 36E or convention application 
referred to in section 154 which has a date of applicat ion earlier 
than that of the trade mark in question, taking account, where 
appropriate, of the priorities claimed in respect of the trade 
marks; 
 
(b) a trade mark which, on the date of the application fo r 
registration of the trade mark in question , or where 
appropriate, of the priority claimed in respect of the application, 
was entitled to protection as a well-known trade mark.” 
 
22. The Explanation to Section 11  of the Act as set out above makes it 
clear that for the purposes of Section 11 of the Act, the phrase „earlier trade 
mark‟ would apply only in respect of a registered trade mark. Admittedly, 
the trade mark of the petitioner company was not registered in India at the 
time registration was granted in fa vour of the respondent no.1 . Therefore, 
the petitioner company cannot take benefit of sub-Sections (1) and (2) of

Section 11 of the Act. Even the ground of passing of f under sub-Section (3) 
of Section 11 of the Act would not be available to the petitioner company as 
it has failed to make out a case of having goodwill and reputation in India in 
respect of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟.  
23. Counsel for the petitioner company contends that the respondent no.1 
has failed to prov ide any evidence in respect of its use of  the trade  mark 
„ALPHARD‟. The various invoices filed by respondent no.1 to show the 
user of the aforesaid trade mark is by another entity, „Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟. In this regard, it may be noted that in the present case , registration 
has been obtained by the respondent no.1 on a „proposed to be used basis‟, 
which is permissible under Section 18 of the Act. Therefore, user on the date 
of registration would not be a relevant factor.  The respondent no.1 has 
placed on record various photographs of it s products bearing the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ as also invoices of its sister company , „Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟ from 12th May, 2015 to 1st June, 2018 showing sales of products 
under the trade mark „ALPHARD‟.  Therefore, based  on the material on 
record, it cannot be established that the respondent no.1 has registered the 
trade mark without any bona fide intention to use the same.  
24. In view of the above, the petitioner company has completely failed to 
discharge the onus to show the reputation and goodwill of the mark 
„ALPHARD‟ in India . In fact, it  is not even the case of the petitioner 
company that it is dealing in products under Class 9 and Class 27 anywhere 
in the world. The documents placed on record by the petitioner company do  
not reflect extensive us e of the brand „ALPHARD‟ or establish that the 
brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired a transborder reputation in India in Classes 
9, 12 and 27. The evidence on record shows very limited sales and use of the

product in the Indian market and that too by private parti es. No 
advertisements have been made by the petitioner company in India. It cannot 
be stated that  a substantial number of consumers in India know about the 
existence of the brand „ALPHARD‟.  
25. Therefore, in my considered view, the petitioner company has fail ed 
to make out any ground for rectification of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
registered in Classes 9, 12 and 27 in the favour of the respondent no.1. I find 
no merit in the present rectification petitions filed on behalf of the petitioner 
company. Dismissed.

CASE SET UP BY THE PETITIONER  
2. The case set up in the petition is as under: 
2.1. The petitioner is the registered proprietor of various trademarks wit h 
the word “ Clari”, details of which are given in paragraph 4 of the 
petition. The petitioner is engaged in the business of manufacture and 
sale of a wide range of hair care, skin care, toiletries and beauty 
products.  
2.2. The “CLARIWASH” mark was adopted in 2 010 by the petitioner and 
has been used along with the other “Clari” formative marks. 
2.3. The first of the “Clari” formative marks were adopted by  a company 
by the name of  Cheryl‟s Cosmeceuticals Pvt. Ltd. [hereinafter 
“Cheryl‟s Cosmeceuticals”] in 2009. The petitioner acquired Cheryl‟s 
Cosmeceuticals in 2013 by way of a Deed of Assignment and Asset 
Transfer Agreement.  
2.4. By virtue of the said Deed of Assignment and Transfer  Agreement, 
the reputation and goodwill related to various “Clari” formative marks 
stood transferred to the petitioner. 
2.5. The petitioner is the prior user of the “Clari” formative marks from 
the year 2009 on account of the user of his predecessor. 
2.6. The respondent no.1 applied for registration of the trademark 
“CLARIWASH” in Class 03 on 16 th April, 2010 showing user from 
16th November, 2009. However, the first invoice filed on behalf of the 
respondent no.1 is dated 10th May, 2010, which is after the 
registration of the “Clari” formative marks.  On the other hand, the 
registration granted in favour of the petitioner in respect of trademark 
“CLARI-FI” is of 3rd February, 2010 with user from 1st April, 2009.

2.7. It is further submitted that the respondent no.1 cannot claim the 
benefit of concurrent user under Section 12 of the Trademarks Act as 
there was no use by the respondent no.1 at the time of the trademark 
application. The trademark application was filed on 16 th April, 2010 
and the earliest invoice filed on behalf of the respondent s is of 10 th 
May, 2010. 
2.8. The Examination Report dated 3 rd January, 2012 is sued by the 
Registrar of Trade Marks  wrongly notes the mark of the respondent 
no.1 as “CHARIWASH” instead of “CLARIWASH”. Based on the 
aforesaid Examination Report, the Certificate of Registration of Trade 
Mark was issued in favour of the respondent no.1 for the word mark  
“CHARIWASH”. However, subsequently , the Certificate was 
modified by the Registry to “CLARIWASH”. 
2.9. The procedure adopted by the Registry in changing the Registration 
Certificate of word mark from “CHARIWASH” to “ CLARIWASH” 
was an erroneous . Having discovered the error, the Registry should 
have proceeded for a fresh examination  for the mark 
“CLARIWASH”. Reliance in this regard is placed on the orders of the 
Intellectual Property Appellate Board (I PAB) in Vans Inc. USA v. 
Fateh Chand Bhansali a nd Anr. , 2020 SCC OnLine IPAB 44  and 
Prajapati Constructions Ltd. v.  Manoj Ramanand Prajapati and 
Anr., 2018 SCC OnLine IPAB 313.

3.1. The respondent no.1 has filed a suit for in fringement of the registered 
trademark “ CLARIWASH” of the respondent  no.1 against the 
petitioner, which is pending before the District Courts, Tis Hazari. 
3.2. Even though the Examination Report was in respect of the mark 
“CHARIWASH”, the Trademark Journal  correctly published the 
mark “CLARIWASH” and not “CHARIWASH”. In May, 2012, the 
Trademark Registry erroneously issued Trademark Registration 
Certificate for the word mark “CHARIWASH”. The respondent no.1 
immediately filed an application to rectify the said cle rical error and 
accordingly, the Trademark Registry rectified the error and  issued a 
fresh Trademark Registration Certificate for the correct word mark 
“CLARIWASH”. Reliance is placed on the judgment of a Coordinate 
Bench in Epsilon Publishing House Pvt. L td. v. Union of India and 
Ors., 2009 SCC OnLine Del 3922.  
3.3. Though the petitioner claims adoption of the mark “CLARIWASH” 
in the year 2010, nothing has been filed in support of the same. 
Further, the petitioner has not filed any application for registration  of 
the mark “CLARIWASH” till date. 
3.4. Use of the mark  “CLARIWASH” by the petitioner or its predecessor 
was only in the year 2013. Attention of the Court in this regard is 
drawn to the invoices filed on behalf petitioner. 
3.5. The petitioner uses several other mar ks other than the “ Clari” 
formative marks. Therefore, it cannot be said that “Clari” belongs to a 
family of marks. 
3.6. The petitioner cannot claim any monopoly on a part of the trademark 
“Clari”. The fact that the petitioner has various marks registered with

the prefix “Clari” does not mean that the registration granted in favour 
of the respondent  no.1 for the mark “CLARIWASH” is defective. 
There are a number of trademarks registered where the word “Clari” 
has been used as a prefix or suffix.  
3.7. The petitioner wa s aware of the  respondent‟s use of the trademark 
“CLARIWASH”, yet never applied for its trademark registration. 
4. Despite opportunity being granted, the respondent no.2 has not filed 
any reply/counter statement or written submissions in the present petition. 
ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS  
5. I have heard the counsels for the parties. 
6. In the present case, it appears from the record that the Trademarks 
Registry erroneously issued t he Examination Report for the mark 
“CHARIWASH” instead of “CLARIWASH”. Yet again, the Registry issued 
a Trademark Registration C ertificate in favour of the respondent , wherein 
the mark of the respondent was wrongly shown as “CHARIWASH”.  
Immediately thereafter, an application was filed on behalf of the respondents 
on 14th June, 2012, requesting for rectification of the clerical error and the 
same was allowed by the Registry and a correct Trademark Registration 
Certificate was issued in favour of the respondent for the mark 
“CLARIWASH”. However, i t is pertinent to note that the mark of the 
respondent no.1 was published correctly as “CLARIWASH” in the 
Trademark Journal No.1519 on 16 th January, 2012.  Therefore, it was open 
for the petitioner or its predecessor  to oppose the said application , which 
they failed to do.

7. If the Registrar has committed an er ror and issued a faulty 
examination report, the respondent no.1 cannot be faulted for the same.  It is 
not that the respondent  no.1 had misrepresented or misled the trademark 
Registry into issuing a faulty examination report.  The registration of a 
trademark entails valuable rights and the respondent no.1 cannot be deprived 
of the same on account of mistake committed by the Registry. T herefore, 
this by itself cannot be the ground for removal of the registration granted in 
favour of the respondent no.1. 
8. In Epsilon Publishing (supra), a Coordinate Bench of this Court was 
seized of a petition challenging the order of the Registrar renewing the 
trademark granted in favour of the respondent therein.  The ground taken by 
the petitioner was that since the responden t had not filed an application for 
renewal of the registration before its expiration and not paid the surcharge, 
the Registrar was required to remove the trademark from the Register.  
While noting that the Trade Marks Registry has not adhered to the statut ory 
timelines, it was held that the respondent cannot be penalized for the same 
and would be entitled to pursue its renewal application.  In the said case, the 
Registrar had admitted that the renewal application filed on behalf of the 
private respondent was not examined and therefore, could not be processed 
further.  It was observed that the private respondent could not be deprived of 
its rights on account of the fault of the Registrar. The relevant observations 
of the court as set out in paragraph 26 are reproduced below: 
“26. There may be merit in the contention that the Registrar 
has to follow the procedure as prescribed; however, the essential 
question is not whether the Registrar has any discretion in the 
matter, but, what are the consequences of the Re gistrar not

following the established procedure? Plainly, in the facts of the 
present case, it is apparent that the Trademark Registry has not 
adhered to the timelines as required. Surely, respondent no.3 
cannot be penalised for the same and would be entitled to purse its 
application for renewal of its trademark. The same was filed well 
within the period of six months and even though the same was not 
accompanied by a fee of surcharge, nonetheless, respondent no.3 
had the right to know the fate of its applic ation. Since no 
deficiency was pointed out at the material time, respondent no.3 
cannot be deprived of its valuable rights to cure the defects within 
the prescribed period. The Registrar also did not advertise the 
removal of the trademark as required under  section 25(4) of the 
Act read with Rule 66 of the 2002 Rules. Such advertisement 
would have provided another opportunity for the petitioner to seek 
restoration of the trademark.” 
9. The dicta of the aforesaid judgment is squarely applicable to the 
present case. The respondent no.1 cannot be deprived of his valuable rights 
of registration on account of the error of the Registry. 
10. Counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the orders passed by the 
IPAB in Prajapati Constructions  (supra) and Vans Inc. USA (supra) in 
support of his submission that the Registrar of Trade Marks has to follow 
the statutory procedure prescribed under the Trade Marks Act , 1999  in 
respect of examination of a trade mark application. At the outset, it may be 
noted that b oth are interim ord ers passed by the IPAB and therefore, no 
reliance can be placed on the same in the present case, which is at the stage 
of final hearing.  After noticing the various procedural lapses committed by 
the Trademark Registry, the IPAB only ordered that the respon dent therein 
shall not rely upon the impugned registration in any proceedings during the 
pendency of the rectification proceedings.  There was no order for removal

of the registration granted in favour of the respondent on account of lapses 
committed by the Registry.  
11. Reliance has also been placed on the order passed by the IPAB in 
Jahangir Biri Factory Pvt. Ltd. v. Mohd. Dildar Hossain (Proporietor) & 
Anr., 2018 (76) PTC 479 [IPAB]. In the aforesaid order, the marks of the 
petitioner and the respondent wer e identical, namely, “HOWRAH BIDI”. 
The respondent therein had merely added a number to the mark “HOWRAH 
BIDI”, which is not the position in the present case. Therefore, the said 
judgment does not further the case of the petitioner. 
12. Counsel for the petitio ner also submitted that the matter be remanded 
back to the Registry for reconsideration of the  trademark application of the 
respondent no.1 from the stage of issuance of examination report . I am not 
inclined to remand back the matter as this would amount t o cancellation of 
the registration already granted in favour of the respondent no.1 as far back 
as in 2012 . Therefore, I proceed to consider the matter on merits, i.e., 
whether the registration in favour of the respondent no.1 was granted 
erroneously. 
13. At t he time when the respondent  no.1 filed its application for 
registration of the mark “CLARIWASH” in 2010, there was one mark of the 
predecessor of the petitioner,  “CLARI-FI”, that was registered in Class 03. 
All other marks of the petitioner with the term “ Clari” have been registered 
subsequent to the registration of the respondent no.1. The petitioner acquired 
rights in the mark “CLARI -FI” in 2013, pursuant to the Asset Transfer 
Agreement dated 19 th September, 2013. It is submitted on behalf of the 
petitioner that since the mark of the respondent no.1, “CLARIWASH” was

similar to the earlier registered trademark “CLARI-FI”, in respect of similar 
goods, the respondent no.1 should not have been granted registration in 
terms of Section 11 of the Trade Marks Act,  1999. In my considered view, 
there is no similarity in  the marks “CLARI-FI” and “CLARIWASH”  so as 
to cause a likelihood of confusion in the public or likelihood of association 
of “CLARIWASH” with “CLARI -FI”. It is a settled position of law that 
while comp aring the marks, the marks have to be seen as a whole and 
cannot be broken into their individual components. Reference in this regard 
may be made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Corn Products 
Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd. , AIR 1960 S C 142.  
Therefore, “CLARIWASH” cannot be read as “CLARI” plus “WASH” and 
similarly, “CLARI-FI” cannot be read as “CLARI” plus “FI”.  Taken as a 
whole, there is no similarity in the competing marks so as to cause 
confusion.  Therefore, on the basis of registr ation of the mark “CLARI-FI”, 
the petitioner cannot seek cancellation of the trademark “ CLARIWASH” 
registered in favour of the respondent no.1 in Class 03.  
14. Under the Asset Transfer Agreement  dated 19th September, 2013, the 
petitioner took over approximate ly 170 marks, both registered and pending 
registration, from Cheryl‟s Consmeceuticals. Only 12 out of  the 170 marks 
use “Clari” as a part of the mark . Therefore, the petitioner cannot say that 
there was a family of marks with the term “Clari” as part of th e marks that 
were registered in favour of the petitioner. 
15. Counsel for the petitioner has contended that even though the user 
shown in the application filed by the respondent no.1 is 16th November, 
2009, the first invoice placed on record is of 12 th May, 2010. In my view,

this would not make any difference as registration can be granted on a 
„proposed to be used‟ basis. Even if the first user of the respondent no.1 is 
taken to be 12 th May, 2010, the user of the petitioner or its predecessor of 
the trademark “CLARIWASH” is after the said date.  Nothing has been 
placed on record on behalf of the petitioner to show that the mark 
“CLARIWASH” was adopted in 2010  either by the petitioner or its 
predecessor. It was only on 22 nd August, 2013 that a license was issued by 
the FDA, Maharashtra in favour of the predecessor of the petitioner, 
Cheryl‟s Cosmec euticals. Even the first invoice placed on record by the 
petitioner that corresponds to the use of “CLARIWASH” is dated 5 th 
December, 2013 and the sales figures in the p etition have been given only 
from the year 2014. It is also relevant to note that the petitioner has not filed 
any application for registration of the mark “CLARIWASH” till date.   
16. In light of the discussion above, no grounds for rectification are made 
out.   
17. The petition is dismissed with no order as to costs.

CASE SET UP IN THE WRITTEN STATEMENT 
6. The case set out in the written statement is as under: 
6.1. The defendant no.1 is in the business of manufacturing various 
railway track components such as concrete sleepers, rail fastening 
components for normal tracks, elevated and underground tracks for 
metro railways and ballastless tracks suit able for high -speed lines, 
bridges, tunnels and the like. 
6.2. The engineering drawings for the ‘Double Resilient Base Plate 
System’ submitted by the defendant no.1 are as per the technical 
specifications, dimensions and features given by the MPMRCL for 
„Design, Supply, Installation, testing and Commissioning of 
Ballastless Track of Standard Gauge, including Supply of Fastening

confer any statutory right in favour of the company/entity who has 
developed and designed such system. 
6.4. The DBRAS purported to have been developed and designed by the 
plaintiff no.1 is not registered under the Patents Act , 1970 or the 
Copyright Act, 1957 or the Designs Act, 2000. 
6.5. The drawings of the plaintiff no.1 are in the public domain, being 
easily available on the internet , as also on the official website of the 
Ministry of Railways. 
6.6. No copyright subsists in the drawings of the plaintiff as per Section 15 
of the Copyright Act, 1957 read in conjunction with the Designs Act, 
2000. 
6.7. The defendant no.1 has not commercially exploited the trademark 
‘PANDROL’ of the plaintiff no.1. The trademark reflected on the 
drawings submitted by the defendant no.1 to various contractors was 
only an inadvertent error on part of the defendants no.2 to 4, who 
mistakenly left the said mark on the drawings while converting them 
from PDF files to AutoCAD files. The said inadvertent error was 
rectified as soon as it was brought to the attention of the defendants 
and the drawings were re -submitted to the contractors without the 
‘PANDROL’ mark. 
6.8. Even otherwise, no manufacturing or production of the Double 
Resilient Base Plate Assembly System componen ts has been 
undertaken by the defendant no.1. Therefore, no case for infringement 
of the trademark of the plaintiff no.1 or passing off is made out.

submitted that the intention of the plaintiffs was not just to safeguard its 
economic interest by filing the present suit but also to prevent the MPMRCL 
from being deceived by the defendants using the copyrighte d drawings and 
trademark of the plaintiffs. 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF  OF THE PLAINTIFFS  
8. In support of the case set up in the plaint, the senior counsel appearing 
on behalf of the plaintiffs made the following submissions: 
8.1. The defendants have infringed the copy right and trademark 
‘PANDROL’ of the plaintiff by copying the drawings of the plaintiffs 
in toto. The said fact has been admitted by the defendants in 
paragraph 21 of the written statement and also affirmed in the report 
dated 22nd September, 2022 filed by the Local Commissioner. 
8.2. Clause 4.2 of the tender floated by the MPMRCL specifically 
provides that a tenderer offering the supply of fastening systems is 
required to provide, inter alia , the approval letter obtained from the 
RDSO/Ministry of Railways along with the approved drawings of the 
fastening system, certificate of performance and the like. Therefore, 
the subject matter of the tender was in respect of a generic product 
and not specifically the plaintiffs’ product . Hence,  there was no 
justification for the defendants to unauthorizedly copy the drawings of 
the plaintiffs. 
8.3. Even if  it is assumed that  the tender of the MPMRCL required 
copying of the approved drawings of the plaintiffs, there was no basis 
for the defendants to expressly provide that the drawings submitted by

them have been drawn, checked, reviewed and approved by the ir 
employees, the defendants no.2 to 5. 
8.4. The drawings of the plaintiffs are not covered under the ambit of 
‘design’ as defined in Section 2(d) of the Designs Act, 2000 for the 
following reasons: 
i. The drawings of the plaintiffs constitute ‘artistic work ’ as 
defined under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957.  
ii. The drawings of the plaintiffs are a mode/principle of 
construction of a fastening system, which is expressly excluded 
from the definition of the word ‘design’  as provided under 
Section 2(d) of the Designs Act. 
iii. There is no visual appeal to the drawings of the plaintiffs which 
would qualify the drawings of the plaintiff to fall in the 
category of ‘design’. 
8.5. Since the drawings of  the plaintiffs do not constitute a „design, which 
is capable of being registered under the Designs Act, 2000‟  the 
reliance placed on Section 15(2) of the Designs Act, 2000 by the 
defendants, is misplaced. 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF  OF THE DEFENDANTS  
9. In suppor t of  the averments  made in the written statement, senior  
counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant s made the following 
submissions: 
9.1. The drawings of the plaintiffs are in the public domain since 2010, 
when they were first published in the United Kingdom . The drawings

have also been published on the RDSO website as attachments to the 
approval letter dated 7th October, 2011. 
9.2. The tenderer was required to match completely with the drawings and 
specifications of the test assembly. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
Clauses 2 and 4 of the approval letter dated 7 th October, 2011 issued 
by the Ministry of Railways. 
9.3. The Ministry of Railways has approved six fastening systems, which 
can be supplied by any vendor on the basis of the approved drawings. 
9.4. Plaintiffs d o not have any copyright over their drawings within the 
meaning of Section 14 of the Copyright Act, 1957. In fact, the 
drawings of the plaintiffs constitute „design capable of being 
registered‟ under the Designs Act, 2000. 
9.5. The plaintiffs have already suppl ied more than 21,00,000 fastening 
sets and 50,00,000 elastic rail clips in various projects. Reliance in 
this regard is placed on paragraphs 14, 25 and 26 of the plaint. 
Therefore, no copyright subsists in the drawings of the plaintiffs as 
per Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957. 
ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS  
10. I have heard the rival submissions. 
11. At the outset, I will address the submissions made on behalf of the 
defendants that the plaintiffs could not claim any copyright in the aforesaid 
drawings in light of S ection 15(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957. To consider 
the aforesaid submissions, a reference may be made to the relevant 
provisions of the Copyright Act as well as the Designs Act.

14. Senior counsel on behalf of the defendants has submitted that that 
since the drawings of the plaintiffs are capable of being registered under th e 
Designs Act and based on the said drawings, products have be en produced 
by the plaintiffs more than fifty times through an industrial  process, no 
copyright can be claimed by the plaintiffs in respect of the said drawings in 
terms of Section 15(2) of the Designs Act. In support of this submission, 
senior counsel for the defendants has placed reliance on various judgments, 
which are discussed below. 
15. In Microfibres Inc v. Girdhar And Co. and Anr. , 2009 SCC OnLine 
Del 1647 a Division Bench of this Court was s eized of similar issues with 
regard to the interplay of various sections of the Copyright and Designs Act 
in order to determine whether a work is capable of being registered under 
the Designs Act, by virtue of which no copyright in respect thereof could be  
claimed as per Section 15(2) of  the Copyright Act. After comparing the 
relevant provisions of the Designs Act and Copyright Act, the Division 
Bench observed as under: 
“22. Therefore, it is the exclusive right of the holder of a 
Copyright in an original ar tistic work to reproduce the work in 
any material form. For example, a drawing of an imaginary 
futuristic automobile, which is an original artistic work, may be 
reproduced in the three -dimensional material form using an 
element, such as a metal sheet. When the copyright holder of an 
original artistic work reproduces the same in another material 
form, he may, or may not do so by employing an industrial 
process or means which may be manual, mechanical or 
chemical, separate or combined, on an article. If the 
reproduction of the original artistic work is done by employing 
an industrial process, as aforesaid, on an article, and the same 
results in a finished article which appeals to the eye as 
adjudged solely by the eye, then the features of shape,

CS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 13 of 27 
 
configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or 
colours applied to the article by the industrial process 
constitutes a “design”, within the meaning of this expression as 
defined under the Designs Act. 
23. There is, therefore, a clear distinction between an 
original artistic work, and the design derived from it for 
industrial application on an article. This position is clarified by 
the use of the expression “only” before the words “the features 
of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of 
lines or colours” in the definition of “design” in the Designs 
Act. Therefore, the original artistic work, which may have 
inspired the creation of a design, is not merely the feature of 
shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines 
or colours which are created to apply to an article by an 
industrial process. The original artistic work is something 
different from the design. Secondly, the definition of “design” 
expressly excludes, inter alia, any artistic work defined in 
section 2(c) of the Copyright act, 1957. 
XXX    XXX    XXX 
30. Sub-section (2) of section 15 deals with the situation 
where the design, which is capable of being registered under the 
Designs Act, is not so registered. It provides that copyright in 
such a design shall cease as soo n as any article to which the 
design has been applied has been reproduced more than 50 times 
by an industrial process by the owner of the copyright or with his 
licence, by any other person. It is clear to us that the Parliament 
in Section 15 of the Copyrig ht Act was dealing with the aspect of 
copyright in a registered/registrable design, as understood in the 
Copyright Act and not the Designs Act. Else, there was no need 
to deal with this aspect in the Copyright Act. The same would 
have been dealt with under  the Designs Act. Therefore, the law 
tolerates only a limited industrial, or shall we say commercial, 
exploitation of the original artistic work by the 
application/reproduction of the said work in any other form or 
reproduction of copies thereof in exercis e of the rights under 
Section 14(c)(1) and 14(c)(iii) of the Copyright Act. Beyond the 
specified limit, if the design derived from the original artistic

by an industrial process on an article) the copyright in the design 
ceases unless it is registered under the Designs Act. 
XXX    XXX    XXX 
35. However, there can be no quarrel with the plea of Shri 
Ramachandran that the operation of Section 15(2) of the 
Copyright Act does not exclude from the ambit of Copyright 
protection either the original “artistic work” upon which the 
design is based or the design which by itself is an artistic work. 
It cannot be disputed that the original paintings/artistic works 
which may be used to industrially produ ce the designed article 
would continue to fall within the meaning of the artistic work 
defined under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957 and 
would be entitled to the full period of copyright protection.  This 
is also evident from the definition of the d esign under Section 
2(d) of the Designs Act. This, in our view, in fact is a factor 
which would go against the appellants in construing the nature 
of protection to be given to the original artistic work such as a 
painting, as contrasted with the applied ar tistic work that is the 
design, which in the present case does not mean the 
intermediary medium such as a mould, engraving 
devised/produced only to enable industrial application of the 
painting to produce the furnishing products of the appellant. 
Thus, whi le the original painting would indeed be entitled to 
the copyright protection, the commercial/industrial 
manifestation of such paintings such as the design derived from 
and founded upon the original painting for the purpose of 
industrial production of furn ishings would only be covered by 
the limitations placed in Section 15 of the Copyright Act and 
would get protection if registered as a design under the Designs 
Act but would enjoy lesser period of protection in case of a 
registered design. 
36. This clearly  shows that the legislature intended that 
even if the artistic work such as a painting has been used as the 
basis for designing an industrially produced object for 
commerce, such as the furnishing in the present case, 
nevertheless the original painting wou ld indeed enjoy full

copyright protection, while the result of the industrial 
application of such painting, namely, the design used in the 
industrial production of the ultimate product shall enjoy lesser 
period of protection as stipulated under the Designs  Act 
provided it is registered as a design under the Designs 
Act. Thus, we are of the view that an original artistic work 
initially acquires protection under the Copyright Act as an 
„artistic work‟ or else the protection under the Designs Act qua 
the produ ct created from the artistic work when industrially 
applied.” 
16. The law was summarised by the Division Bench in paragraph 46 of 
the judgment, which is set out below: 
“46. We thus summarize our findings as follows:— 
a. The definition of „artistic work‟ has a very wide 
connotation as it is not circumscribed by any limitation of 
the work possessing any artistic quality. Even an abstract 
work, such as a few lines or curves arbitrarily drawn 
would qualify as an artistic work. It may be two 
dimensional or three dim ensional. The artistic work may 
or may not have visual appeal. 
b. The rights to which a holder of an original artistic work 
is entitled are enumerated in Section 14(c) of the Copyright 
act. 
c. It is the exclusive right of the holder of a Copyright in an 
original artistic work to reproduce the work in any material 
form. For example, a drawing of an imaginary futuristic 
automobile, which is an original artistic work, may be 
reproduced in the three-dimensional material form using an 
element, such as a metal sheet. 
d. The design protection in case of registered works under 
the Designs Act cannot be extended to include the copyright 
protection to the works which were industrially produced.

e. A perusal of the Copyright Act and the Designs Act and 
indeed the Pream ble and the Statement of Objects and 
Reasons of the Designs Act makes it clear that the 
legislative intent was to grant a higher protection to pure 
original artistic works such as paintings, sculptures etc 
and lesser protection to design activity which is 
commercial in nature. The legislative intent is, thus, clear 
that the protection accorded to a work which is 
commercial in nature is lesser than and not to be equated 
with the protection granted to a work of pure art. 
f. The original paintings/artistic works which may be used 
to industrially produce the designed article would continue 
to fall within the meaning of the artistic work defined 
under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957 and would 
be entitled to the full period of copyright protection as 
evident from the definition of the design under Section 
2(d) of the Designs Act. However, the intention of 
producing the artistic work is not relevant. 
g. This is precisely why the legislature not only limited the 
protection by mandating that the copyright shal l cease 
under the Copyright Act in a registered design but in 
addition, also deprived copyright protection to designs 
capable of being registered under the Designs Act, but not 
so registered, as soon as the concerned design had been 
applied more than 50 ti mes by industrial process by the 
owner of the copyright or his licensee. 
h. In the original work of art, copyright would exist and 
the author/holder would continue enjoying the longer 
protection granted under the Copyright Act in respect of 
the original artistic work per se. 
i. If the design is registered under the Designs Act, the 
Design would lose its copyright protection under the 
Copyright Act. If it is a design registrable under the Designs 
Act but has not so been registered, the Design would 
continue to enjoy copyright protection under the Act so long 
as the threshold limit of its application on an article by an

industrial process for more than 50 times is reached. But 
once that limit is crossed, it would lose its copyright 
protection under the Copyrig ht Act. This interpretation 
would harmonize the Copyright and the Designs Act in 
accordance with the legislative intent.” 
17. What emerges from a reading of the judgment of the Division Bench 
is that an original ‘artistic work’ is different from a ‘design’. Th e original 
drawings/ ‘artistic work’ can lead to a ‘design’. In other words, a ‘design’ 
may be derived from the original drawings. Therefore, even if the original 
drawings/ ‘ artistic work ’ is used to industrially produce an article,  the 
original drawing/ ‘ artistic work’ would continue to fall within the meaning 
of the artistic work defined under Section 2 (c) of the Copyright Act, 1957 
and would be entitled to the full period of copyright protection. 
18. In Mody Pumps Inc and Anr. v. Sovereign Pumping Solutions 
Provate Limited and Anr. , MANU/MH/1496/2022 a Single Bench of the 
Bombay High Court was dealing with a similar issue of copyright 
infringement in relation to engineering drawings of water pumps and the 
issues that arose were whether the aforesaid engineering drawings constitute 
‘artistic work ’ and whether the plaintiffs have copyright in the same. 
Relying upon the judgment of the Division Bench in Microfibres (supra), 
the Bombay High Court held that drawings are ‘artistic works’ within the 
meaning of Sectio n 13(1)(a) of the Copyrights Act and are therefore, 
excluded from the purview of Section 2(d) of the Designs Act.  It was 
observed by the Bombay High Court that i n terms of Section 2(d) of the 
Designs Act, 2000, design relates only to shape, configuration, pattern, 
ornament or composition of lines or colours  applied to an article, which, in 
the finished article, would have a visual appeal. Further, ‘design’ under

Section 2(d) does not include any mode or principle of construction or 
anything which is, in substance, a mere mechanical device. Section 2(d) also 
excludes any ‘artistic work’ as defined in Section 2(c) of the Copyrights Act.  
19. In the present case, the plaintiffs claim copyright in respect of their 
original drawings. In terms of the judgment in Microfibres (supra), even if 
the original drawings may be used to industrially produce an article, they 
would continue to fall within the meaning of ‘artistic work’ under Section 
2(c) of the Copyright Act and also continue to enjoy full copyright 
protection.  
20. It is also to be noted that a  ‘design’ in respect of a finished product is 
yet to emerge in the present case. Therefore, no ‘design’ capable of 
registration under the Designs Act has come out  on the basis of the 
plaintiffs’ drawings. Additionally, t he drawi ngs of the plaintiffs relate to 
fastening systems, which are mere mechanical devices that have functional 
utility. By no stretch of imagination can it be said that the aforesaid 
drawings reflect a product, which, in its finished state, would have any 
visual appeal. Consequently, the aforesaid drawings are not be capable of 
being registered as a ‘design’ under the Designs Act. 
21. Counsel for the defendants has placed reliance on t he judgments in 
Holland Company LP and Anr. v. S. P. Indusries, 2017 SCC OnLine De l 
9370 and Jagdamba Impex v. Tristar Products Pvt. Ltd., 2014 SCC Online 
Del 2872. However, the said judgments  do not take into consideration the 
earlier decision of the Division Bench in Microfibres (supra), which I have 
relied on to reach the conclusion above. Therefore, need is not felt to delve 
into the aforesaid judgments.

22. Now, I shall address the issue of whether any copyright for the 
aforesaid drawings vests with the plaintiffs or if it has been assigned in 
favour of the Ministry of Railways. 
23. The Ministry of Railways laid down the performance criteria for 
„fastening system for ballastlass track on metro railways‟  vide its 
communication dated 21 st May, 2010. The said communication also 
provided that metro/MRTS were free to choose their fastening system for 
ballastlass track complying with the per formance criteria.  In terms of the 
aforesaid performance criteria laid down by the Ministry, the plaintiff s 
obtained approval from the Ministry of Railways. 
24. At this stage , a reference may be made to the approval  given by the 
Ministry of Railways to the plaintiffs on 7 th October, 2011. The subject 
matter of the said approval reads as follows: 
“Double Resilient Base Plate Assembly Fastening system -
corrigendum reg.” 
25. The other relevant terms of the said approval are set out below: 
“…..Accordingly, to operationalize the approval given to the 
double resilient baseplate assembly system, the following is 
advised:-  
 
1. A copy of the Performance Certificate of the Dubai Metro 
dated 28.10.2010, based on which RDSO has considered the 
performance of the system, is attached herewith as 
Annexure-1. The Metro Railways/MRTS System should 
verify the authenticity of the system proposed to be used by 
them vis-à-vis this Performance Certificate.

system as used in the test assembly, which has been 
examined and cleared, are enclosed as Annexure -2. The

Metro Railways/MRTS System should make sure that the 
system, if used by them, matches completely with the 
drawing and specifications of the test assembly examined 
by RDSO. The metro railway/MRTS system are at liberty 
to carry out any tests for this as considered necessary. 
 
3. Before this system is installed in the track, Metro 
Railways/MRTS System should satisfy themselves about 
their chosen fastening system  meeting the physical 
parameters requirements of the Performance Criteria, by 
conducting fresh tests from an independent laboratory on 
samples selected by Metro Railway/MRTS system. 
 
4. The clearance is only for the “double resilient  base 
plate assembly fastening system” of M/S Pandrol Limited, 
UK., Metro Railways/MRTS Systems should verify 
themselves about the credentials of the prospective 
suppliers of this system.” 
 
26. In view of the approval granted to the plaintiffs, the products of the 
plaintiffs became eligible for being tendered for various metro projects. 
There is nothing in the aforesaid approval letter to suggest that the copyright 
in respect of the plaintiffs’ drawings  was to vest with the Ministry of 
Railways or that the plai ntiffs have waived their copyright in respect of the 
aforesaid drawings. Defendants have failed to place any documents or 
material in support of their contention that the copyright in respect of the 
drawings of the plaintiff s has been waived by the plainti ffs. Even if it is 
assumed that the copyright has been transferred to the Ministry of Railways, 
it does not give any right in favour of the defendants to copy the said 
drawings. Hence, there is no merit in the submission of the defendants that 
once the dra wings of the plaintiffs got approval from the Ministry of 
Railways and were annexed to the approval letter , they become a part of the

catalogue of the Ministry and any third party can make a bid based on the 
aforesaid drawings. 
27. Reliance placed on behalf of  defendants on Clauses 2 and 4 of the 
approval letter dated 7 th October, 2011 to submit that the tenderers have to 
completely match the drawings and specifications of the test assembly 
examined by RDSO, is completely misplaced. The aforesaid clauses are 
only in relation to approval granted to the plaintiffs. The reference to 
„prospective suppliers‟ in Clause 4 would only mean authorised suppliers of 
the said products. This would not, in any manner, give a license to other 
suppliers to use the copyrighted works of the plaintiffs. 
28. Senior counsel on behalf of the defendants has submitted that in terms 
of the tender document floated by the MPMRCL, for a party to bid for the 
aforesaid tender, it had to bid in terms of the drawings of the plaintiffs.  
29. At this stage, reference may be made to the relevant part of the tender. 
The scope of the tender is set out below: 
“„Design, Supply, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of 
Ballastless Track of Standard Gauge, including Supply of

fastening system and its individual components supplied by 
Supplier shall be with Tenderer for the defect liability period.” 
31. Based on the above, it was contended on behalf of the defendants that 
once it is the requirement of the MPMRCL itself that the product s to be 
tendered have to be in line with the drawings of the plaintiffs , the plaintiffs 
cannot contend that the defendants have copied the same. The defendants 
were obligated to bid for the tender on the basis of the drawings of the 
plaintiffs. 
32. Senior counsel on behalf of the plaintiffs correctly points out that the 
aforesaid tender of  the MPMRCL was not in respect of products to be 
manufactured specifically in te rms of plaintiffs’ drawings. The tender 
floated by  the MPMRCL was in respect of „design, supply, installation, 
testing and commissioning of ballastless track of standard gauge, including 
supply of fastening system ‟. The same is reiterated in clause 4.2.1(i ii) 
extracted above. The drawings developed and designed by the plaintiff s, as 
can be seen from the approval letter, were for the DBRAS. Therefore, it 
cannot be said that the tender was confined to products based on the 
plaintiffs’ drawings. The tender was  for a generic product and the drawings 
of the plaintiffs were only one of the approved drawings. Therefore, there is 
no merit in the submission of the defendants that the tender floated was in 
respect of a specific product to be manufactured as per  the drawings of the

plaintiffs and consequently, the defendants did not have any option but to 
copy the drawings of the plaintiffs in order to manufacture the said product.  
33. In fact,  any party who had  obtained approvals from the Ministry of 
Railways could have supplied the products  under the aforesaid tender. It is 
the defendants’ own case that approvals have been received by six 
companies/entities for the aforesaid products and each one of them was free 
to bid for the tender. If the defendants failed to prepare their own drawings 
and get the same approved from the Ministry of Railways, the defendants 
cannot be permitted to copy the drawings of the plaintiffs. 
34. A perusal of paragraphs (ix) of clause 4.2.1 of the tender document  
extracted above would show that the t enderer could be a person other than 
the six companies/entities with the RDSO/Ministry of Railways approvals. 
Therefore, it was open for the defendants to approach one of the 
companies/entities whose drawings had been approved or their supplier(s) 
and obtain a licence/enter into an agreement in respect thereof, to bid for the 
tender. 
35. Clearly, the plaintiffs would have spent considerable time, effort and 
financial resources and undertaken extensive research and development to 
create the aforesaid drawings.  If the contention of the defendants is 
accepted, then it would be open for any person to copy the work of another 
and commercially exploit  the effort s of the original creator . This would  
amount to permitting the defendants to unjustly enrich themselves at t he 
expense of the plaintiffs.  
36. I am not persuaded  by the submission of the defendants that if 
suppliers that do not have RDSO/Ministry of Railways approvals are barred 
from using the drawings of the plaintiffs, a monopoly would be created in

favour of the plaintiffs. There cannot be any question of a monopoly by the 
plaintiffs as besides the plaintiff s, five other companies/entities have 
received approvals from the RDSO/Ministry of Railways.  
37. It has vehemently been contended on behalf of the defendants that  
plaintiffs have not impleaded the Ministry Railways in the present suit and 
that their presence is necessary to determine the question of whether any 
copyright vests with the plaintiff s or if it has been assigned in favour of the 
Ministry of Railways. In my view, the aforesaid submission is completely 
unsustainable. It is the case of the defendants that plaintiffs have 
assigned/waived the copyright in favour of the Ministry of Railways or that 
the copyright vests with the Ministry of Railways. Therefore, the onus is on 
the defendants to prove that the copyright has been assigned /waived by the 
plaintiff in favour of the Ministry of Railways or that the same vests with the 
Ministry of Railways in any case. The stand of the  Ministry of Railways, in 
the present case, would be wholly irrelevant.  
38. Furthermore, there is no merit in the submission of the defendants that 
no copyright subsists in the drawings of the plaintiffs since no registration 
has been obtained in respect thereof. Registration is not a prerequisi te to 
seeking protection from infringement under the Copyright Act.  
39. Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the defendants has not disputed 
the fact that the drawings of the plaintiffs have been copied in toto by the 
defendants. However, he justifies the sa me by submitting that since the 
aforesaid drawings of the plaintiffs were approved by the Ministry of 
Railways and tenderers were required to bid in terms of the said approval, 
the defendants did not have any choice but to copy the drawings of the 
plaintiffs. Interestingly, on one hand, the defendants admit that they have

copied the drawings of the plaintiffs,  yet in the drawings of the defendants it 
has been noted that the said drawings have been drawn, checked, reviewed 
and approved by different personne l of the defendant no.1. Clearly, the 
attempt of the defendants in doing so was to show the drawing as their own 
original work. 
40. If the defendants actually believed that there was no copyright in the 
drawings of the plaintiffs and they could freely copy the  same, there was no 
need to put the name of their own personnel as the creators of the aforesaid 
drawings. The extent of copying by the defendants is not confined just to the 
drawings of the plaintiffs but goes on to include the unique numbering given 
to the said drawings by the plaintiffs. Reference in this regard may be made 
to pages 13 to 38 of the documents of the plaintiff.  Further, while copying 
the aforesaid drawings, the defendants have also copied the mark 
‘PANDROL’ of the plaintiffs in some of th e drawings , though the 
defendants submit that it was on account of an inadvertent error. 
41. A reference to the Report of the Local Commissioners appointed by 
the Court reveals that when the Local Commissioners visited the premises of 
the defendants, the syste ms/laptops of the personnel of the defendants 
contained the original drawings of the plaintiffs bearing the trademark of the 
plaintiffs, ‘PANDROL’. The Report also states that when the Local 
Commissioners searched for the term ‘PANDROL’ on the two laptops of the 
defendants, various documents showed up, which included various drawings 
of the plaintiffs and other ‘PANDROL’ related data. When asked about the 
existence of such data on their systems, no explanation was forthcoming 
from the defendants as to how did they obtain such data of the plaintiffs.

42. The discussion above leaves no doubt in my mind that the defendants 
have dishonestly copied the drawings in respect of which the copyright vests 
solely with the plaintiffs. Further, this has been done in a brazen manner so 
as to derive a competitive advantage.  In my considered view, this can 
neither be permitted nor condoned. 
43. Accordingly, the present application filed on behalf of the plaintiffs 
under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC is allowed and the order 
dated 2nd September, 2022 is confirmed till the final adjudication of the suit. 
44. Taking into account the conduct of the defendants  in having 
completely copied the drawings of the plaintiffs  and seeking to justify the 
same, the defendants are burdened with co sts of Rs.1,00,000/- to be paid to 
the plaintiffs. 
45. Needless to state, any observations made herein are only for the 
purposes of adjudication of the present application and would have no 
bearing on the final outcome of the suit.

1. The present rectification petitions have b een filed on behalf of the 
petitioner company in the year 2018 seeking rectification of the trade mark 
register by removal of registrations granted in favour of the respondent no.1 
in respect of trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in (i) Class 9 in relation to car 
radios/stereos, navigation apparatus for vehicles ; (ii) Class 12 in relation to 
automobiles and various car accessories  and (iii) Class 27 in relation to 
automobile carpets , bearing registration no.3093216, 3093218, 3093219

erstwhile Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), however, due to the 
enactment of the  Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021, the petitions have been 
placed before this Court. 
2. Notice in the aforesaid rectification petitions was  issued by the IPAB 
on 8th February, 2019. Counter statements thereto have been filed on behalf 
of the respondent  no.1 and rejoinder has been filed on behalf of the 
petitioner company. 
3. Since all the three petitions raise similar issues, they are being decided 
by way of a common judgment. 
BRIEF FACTS 
4. Briefly, the case set up by the petitioner company is as under: 
4.1 The pe titioner company, incorporated in Japan , is an automotive 
manufacturer and operates throughout the world.  The vehicles of the 
petitioner company are sold in more than 170 countries and the 
petitioner company conducts business worldwide with 53 overseas 
manufacturing companies in 28 countries and regions.  
4.2 The petitioner company entered the Indian market in a joint venture 
with the Kirloskar Gr oup in 1997 known as Toyota Kirloskar Motor 
Pvt. Ltd. and set up manufacturing facilities in India.   
4.3 The petitioner company owns various distinctive and well -known 
trademarks, one of which include s the trade mark „ALPHARD‟. The 
aforesaid trade mark was ad opted by the petitioner company in the 
year 1986 and a luxury MUV under the said brand was launched in 
the year 2002. 
4.4 Though, the petitioner company‟s vehicle under the trade  mark

„ALPHARD‟ has not yet been form ally launched in India, the same 
has been available in the country for the last many years on account of 
direct import s by Indian residen ts. The earliest registration of the 
petitioner company‟s mark „ALPHARD‟ dates back to 1986 and the 
said trade  mark is registered in various jurisdictions, such as Japan, 
China, Singapore etc.   
4.5 The petitioner company has sold more than 8,50,000 units under the 
trade mark „ALPHARD‟ since its launch in 2002.  The details of sales 
figures as well as advertising and promotional expenses incurred by 
the petitioner company from 2002 -2017 ha ve been given in the 
petition. 
4.6 The petitioner  company‟s trade  mark „ALPHARD‟ is well -known 
throughout the world and ha s acquired a secondary meaning with the 
people associated with the trade associating the same with the 
petitioner. 
4.7 The petitioner company applied for registration of the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ on a „ proposed to be used basis ‟ on 21st November, 
2017 and the same has been objected to by the Registry.  
4.8 The respondent no.1 obtained registration of the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ under Classes 9, 12 and 27 on 5th November, 2015 on a 
„proposed to be used basis‟. 
4.9 Adoption of the petitioner  company‟s trade  mark by the respondent 
no.1 in relation to goods in the allied/cognate field has been done in a 
mala fide  manner so as to trade upon the  petitioner company‟s 
goodwill and reputation.

summarized as under: 
5.1 Respondent no.1 is the prior user and bona fide adopter of the trade  
mark „ALPHARD‟ for goods under Class es 9, 12 and 27 since the 
year 2015. 
5.2 The respondent no.1 coined and adopted the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
in the year 2015 and since its adoption , the respondent no.1 has been 
continuously and extensively using the said trade mark. 
5.3 The aforesaid trade mark has been used by the respo ndent no.1 along 
with its sister companies, „Tekstar Global Private Limited ‟ and „Sai 
Supertrek Global Private Limited‟.    
5.4 Though the petitioner company applied for the registration of its trade 
mark „ALPHARD in Class 12 , it is an admitted position that t he 
petitioner company has not used the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in India. 
5.5 In light of the non -user by the petitioner  Company, there cannot be 
any goodwill or transborder reputation in respect of the aforesaid 
trade mark in India.   
5.6 The petitioner company has made contradictory claims in its petition.  
On one hand, the petitioner company claims that the petitioner ‟s 
vehicles under the aforesaid trade mark were available in India from 
the year 2008 , on the other hand, the trade mark  registration 
application has b een filed by the petitioner company on a „ proposed 
to be used basis‟ in November, 2017.

6.1 Vehicles bearing the petitioner  company‟s trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
have been sold in India as far back as 2008.  Reliance is placed on 
printouts from third -party websites showing listings of the petitioner  
company‟s vehicles in India for sale. 
6.2 Petitioner company‟s trade mark „ALPHARD‟ enjoys a world wide 
reputation and the same has a direct spillover in India. In this regard, 
petitioner company has placed on record international 
brochures/annual reports, awards, worldwide trade mark registration 
certificates/renewal certificates and promotional material in respect of 
the mark „ALPHARD‟.  
6.3 The invoices placed on record on behalf of the respondent no.1 are 
not of the respondent no.1  company but of „ Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟.   
6.4 Registration could not have been granted to the respondent no.1  in 
terms of Sections 11(1), 11(2), 11(3) and 11(10) of the Trade Marks 
Act, 1999 (hereinafter „the Act‟).

trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in  India in  any of the three classes  viz., 
Class 9, Class 12 and Class 27, where the mark has been registered in 
favour of the respondent no.1. Further, the trade mar k „ALPHARD‟ 
has not been used by the petitioner company in Classes 9 or 27 even 
outside India. 
7.2 The products of the respondent no.1 have been continuously sold 
under the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ since the year 2015.  Reliance in 
this regard is placed on the inv oices of „Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟, sister company of the respondent no.1.   
7.3 The word „ALPHARD‟ is the name of a star and therefore, the same 
has been adopted by the respondent no.1 in a bona fide manner.  Its 
use in relation to car accessories is completely arbitrary and fanciful.  
7.4 The provisions of Section s 11(1), 11(2) and 11(3) of the Act have no 
application in the present case as there is no earlier registered trade 
mark in the present case.   
7.5 Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Co urt in Toyota 
Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha v. Prius Auto Industries Ltd. , (2018) 2 
SCC 1 and the order of IPAB in Hypnos Limited v. Hosur Coir 
Foam Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. , 2015 SCC OnLine IPAB 213 , to contend 
that in the present case , there is no transnational rep utation available 
to the petitioner company in India.

for determining transnational reputation. It was the case of Toyota that the 
car under the brand  „Prius‟ was launched in Japan in 1997 and in other 
countries in 2000 -2001. However, „Prius‟ was released in India in the year 
2009 and formally launched in the year 2010.  The respondent (defendant in 
the suit), had got the mark „Prius‟ registered in India in 2002  in respect of 
auto parts and accessories  and was using the said mark in India since 2001. 
A suit for  infringement of the mark „Prius‟ and  passing off was filed by 
Toyota against the respondent. After a full trial, a Single Judge of this Court 
held that the acts of the respondent amounted to passing off of the 
respondent‟s goods under the trade name „Prius‟ and consequently granted a 
permanent injunction in favour of the plaintiff . In appeal, the Division 
Bench reversed the judgment of the Single Judge and declined the relief of 
permanent injunction. This was challenged by Toyota before the Supreme 
Court.  
10. Relying upon the judgments of the Courts in the U.K. and Australia 
and the passages from the book „ The Law of Passing -Off‟ by Prof. 
Christopher Wadlow, the Supreme Court applied the „territoriality 
principle‟ and held that the transnational reputation of Toyota in respect of 
the trade mark 'Prius‟ has not spilled over to India and hence, did not grant 
permanent injunction in favour of Toyota . The relevant observations of the 
Supreme Court with regard to the application of the „territoriality principle‟ 
are set out below: 
“32.  Prof. Cristopher Wadlow's view on the subject appears to 
be that the test of whether a foreign claimant may succeed in a 
passing-off action is whether his business has a goodwill in a 
particular jurisdiction, which criterion is broader than the 
“obsolete” t est of whether a claimant has a business/place of

business in that jurisdiction. If there are customers for the 
claimant's products in that jurisdiction, then the claimant stands 
in the same position as a domestic trader. 
 
33.  The overwhelming judicial and academic opinion all over 
the globe, therefore, seems to be in favour of the territoriality 
principle. We do not see why the same should not apply to this 
country. 
 
34.  To give effect to the territoriality principle, the courts 
must necessarily have to determine if there has been a spillover 
of the reputation and goodwill of the mark used by the claimant 
who has brought the passing -off action. In the course of such 
determination it may be necessary to seek and ascertain the 
existence of not necessarily a  real market but the presence of 
the claimant through its mark within a particular territorial 
jurisdiction in a more subtle form which can best be manifested 
by the following illustrations, though they arise from decisions of 
courts which may not be final in that particular jurisdiction.” 
 
11. Applying the aforesaid principle s to the facts of the case before the 
Supreme Court in Toyota (supra), it was observed as under: 
(i) Undoubtedly, t he trade mark „Prius‟ has acquired a great deal of 
goodwill in various other jurisdictions in the world before  its use and 
registration by the respondent in India. 
(ii) Merely on account of advertisements in automobile magazines, 
international business magazines and information on the internet, it 
cannot be said that the aforesaid produ ct has acquired the necessary 
goodwill and reputation in the Indian market. 
(iii) The evidence on record also showed very limited sale s of the product 
in the Indian market and no advertisement prior to the registration by 
the defendant.

(iv) The plaintiff failed to f urnish sufficient proof of knowledge and 
information about the product in India. 
(v) The brand name of the car „Prius‟ had not acquired the degree of 
goodwill, reputation and popularity in the Indian market so as to 
create a right of prior user in favour of To yota against a registered 
owner. 
12.  To a similar effect is the order of the IPAB in Hypnos Limited  
(supra).  In the said case, the applicant was the registered proprietor of the 
mark „Hypnos‟, adopted several decades ago in relation to beds , mattresses, 
pillows, etc.  It was also the case of the applicant that beds bearing the trade 
mark „Hypnos‟ had been supplied by the applicant to hotels in India in the 
years 2008 to 2010.  The respondent‟s trade mark was registered in Class 20 
in the year 2007. It was the  case of the applicant that the respondent had 
dishonestly adopted and obtained registration of the trade mark „Hypnos‟ in 
India and started using the same for selling similar goods. Rejecting the 
submission of the applicant that the impugned trade mark „H ypnos‟ is a 
„well-known trademark‟ and carries transborder reputation , which has 
spilled over to India, the IPAB dismissed the rectification petition. The 
relevant observations are as under: 
“81.  We agree with the proposition propounded in the 
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court on same issue, wherein the 
Hon'ble Apex court has held that in the case of  National Sewing 
Thread Co. Ltd. v. James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd. (Supra). 
 
“Wherein the Hon'ble court has taken view that “the suit of 
passing-off and the oppos ition proceedings pending before 
the Registrar of Trademarks are different from each other”. 
 
82.  We are also of the same opinion as this proposition lay

down in above judgment that the rectification proceeding under 
section 57 of the trademarks Act is al so altogether quite 
different from the suit of passing off or of opposition 
proceedings before the Registrar . The rectification proceedings 
before the board under section 57 of the trademarks Act cannot 
be equated to be similar with as in the case of passi ng off action, 
where the burden rests on the plaintiff to prove whether there is 
likelihood of the defendant's goods being passed off as the goods 
of the plaintiff but in rectification proceedings under section 57 
of the trademarks Act it deals with the po wer to cancel or vary 
registration on many grounds and to expunge the trademark from 
the register is based on different tenets altogether not as in the 
case suit for passing off, as such the rectification application also 
has inherent different structure in totality than the suit of passing 
off. 
 
83.  To claim Trans -border reputation for a mark in India, 
the impugned trademark ‘Hypnos’ must be well known 
substantial segment of consumers in India must know about the 
existence of the mark of the foreign entit y. Such knowledge 
may come from free availability of the product to Indian 
consumers or extensive advertising, which reaches a 
substantial segment of Indian consumers because of extensive 
circulation of those advertisements in India. 
 
84.  After going thro ugh the pleading and rival contention 
of the parties. We have observed that even assuming the 
applicant's trademark acquired reputation in foreign countries, 
where their trade mark is registered, but no presumption can be 
drawn at this juncture that trade mark of the applicant 
registered in foreign countries has automatically acquired 
reputation in India or trans -border reputation is percolated in 
India, as we have already pointed out that no document of the 
applicant shows of its extensive usage of the mar k in India or 
any other place of registration.

applicant has trans -border reputation due to its long and

extensive use of the impugned trademark in question and the 
impugned trademark „Hypnos‟ is well known. The applicant has 
further failed to establish that the trademark “Hypnos” has 
attained the reputation and goodwill which has spilled over in to 
other countries and India. The substantial segments of consumers 
in India know about the existence o f the mark „Hypnos‟ as of the 
foreign entity. 
 
86.  It is well settled proposition that the onus is on the 
applicant applying rectification to establish by letting his 
evidence about the trans -border reputation, so the burden is on 
the applicant herein, th e applicant has to discharge his burden 
by showing extensive use and making out strong ground for 
rectification. The applicant applying for rectification application 
has to discharge its onus in removing of registered trademark 
from register.

88. We have also gone through the authorities submitted by the 
respondent in  support of his contention. We agree with 
propounded proposition in the above citations  that the onus is 
on the applicant to discharge by producing substantial evidence 
in his  support and it is burden on the applicant to establish 
evidence of extensive, long use  of its mark and show the well

13. In light of the principle s laid down in the aforesaid judgments, it has 
to be examined whether in the present case , the petitioner  company has 
produced sufficient evidence on record in support of its contention that the 
trade mark „ALPHARD‟  carries a transborder reputation that has spilled 
over in India.   
14. Merely, the international usage of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ by the 
petitioner company is not sufficient to prove the spillover of its transnational

reputation in India.  In the present case, the petitioner company has failed to 
place on record a single invoice to show that it has sold any car under the 
brand „ALPHARD‟ in India. In fact, the trade mark application filed on 
behalf of the petitioner company in November, 2017 was on a „proposed to 
be used basis ‟. It is petitioner  company‟s own case that the same model of 
the car has been launched in India under a different brand name, „Vellfire‟.  
15. It is also an admitted position that the petitioner company has not 
advertised the said brand in India in any manner. Various documents placed 
on record by the petitioner company such as, international brochures/annual 
reports, awards, worldwide trade mark registration certificates/renewal 
certificates and promotional material, are in relation to international usage of 
the aforesaid trade mark. Undoubtedly, these documents show that the trade 
mark „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and reputation in several other 
jurisdictions around the world. However, as per the „territoriality principle‟, 
the onus is on the petitioner company to show that the trade  mark 
„ALPHARD‟ had acquired sufficient goodwill and reputation in the Indian 
market also. None of the aforesaid documents filed by the petitioner 
company show s that the brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and 
reputation in India. The documents filed by the petitioner company relating 
to India are screenshots from third-party websites showing that a few cars of 
the petitioner company under the brand „ALPHARD‟ have been listed for 
sale in India. As per the import -export data of India filed on behalf of the 
petitioner company, only fifteen import shipment record s have been found  
under the brand „ALPHARD‟ between the years 2014 to 2016  and not all of 
them are in respect of vehicles . It may be noted that the aforesaid imports 
have not been made by the petitioner company itself but by private parties.

16. The petitioner company has filed certain articles in various 
trade/automobile magazines and newspaper reports regarding the petitioner 
company considering the launch of a vehicle under the brand „ALPHARD‟ 
in India . However, most of these articles are after the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ had already been registered by the respondent no.1 in India. It 
is also to be noted that the vehicle under the brand „ALPHARD‟ was never 
launched in India. The same model was launched in India in February, 2020 
under the brand „Vellfire‟. Therefore, no reliance can be placed on these 
articles to show that the brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and 
reputation in India.  
17. In Toyota (supra), the „Prius‟ model had been introduced by Toyota in 
the India n market in 2009 -2010 and there were advertisements in 
automobile magazines. Despite this, taking note of limited sale s of the 
product in India and the absence of any advertisement of the product in India 
prior to 2001, the Supreme Court held that the trad e mark „Prius‟ cannot be 
said to have acquired goodwill and reputation in the Indian market. The 
present case stands on a worse footing for the petitioner company, as in the 
present case the petitioner company has neither launched the model under 
the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in India nor has advertised the same.  
18. Counsel for the petitioner company has placed reliance on the 
judgments in MAC Personal Care  (supra) and Keller Williams Realty 
(supra) in support of his submission that the transborder reputation in respect 
of a trade mark may have a spillover reputation in India as well, despite the 
aforesaid brand not having a commercial use in India. In MAC Personal 
Care (supra), the D ivision Bench enlisted the principles for determining 
international reputation. Ho wever, the issue of spillover of transnational

reputation in India was not before the Division Bench. These principles were 
laid down by the S upreme Court subsequently in Toyota (supra). Both the 
aforesaid judgments were in the context of passing off actio n and not in the 
context of rectification petitions. To be noted that in Keller Williams Realty 
(supra), the Co -ordinate Bench of this Court denied the relief of interim 
injunction in a passing of f action. One of the reasons for denial of interim 
injunction was that the plaintiff therein had been unable to show spillover of 
its reputation a nd goodwill in India. Therefore, the reliance place d by the 
petitioner company on the aforesaid judgments is misplaced.  
19. As regards the contention of the petitioner company that the adoption 
of the mark „ALPHARD‟  by the respondent no.1 is mala fide, counsel for 
the respondent no.1 has drawn  the attention of the Court to the dictionary 
meaning of the word „Alphard‟1.  The word „Alphard‟ has been described in 
the following manner: 
“an orange star of the second magnitude that is the brightest star 
in the constellation Hydra 
Hydra is actually the largest constellation. Despite its size, it has 
only one bright star named  Alphard. It can be found over in the 
southwest sky all by itself—hence the name, which in Arabic 
means "the solitary one.” 
 
20. Except for making a bald averment, the petitioner company has failed 
to place any material on record to show that the adoption by the respondent 
no.1 was mala fide. Therefore, on the basis o f evidence on record, it cannot 
be held that the adoption of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟  by the respondent 
no.1 was mala fide or in bad faith.

21. Reliance has been placed by the petitioner company on Section 11(1), 
11(2) and 11(3) of the Act to contend that the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
should not have been granted registration in favour of the respondent  no.1 
on account of its identity and similarity with an “ earlier trade mark ”. To 
appreciate this submission, a reference may be made to the relevant 
provisions of Section 11 of the Act, which is set out as under: 
“11. Relative grounds for refusal of registration. — (1) Save as 
provided in section 12, a trade mark shall not be registered if, 
because of— 
 
(a)  its identity with an earlier trade mark  and similarity of 
goods or services covered by the trade mark; or 
 
(b)  its similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or 
similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade mark,  
 
there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, 
which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade 
mark. 
 
(2)  A trade mark which— 
 
(a)  is identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark; and 
 
(b)  is to be registered for goods or serv ices which are not 
similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered in 
the name of a different proprietor,  
 
shall not be registered, if or to the extent, the earlier trade mark 
is a well-known trade mark in India and the use of the later ma rk 
without due cause would take unfair advantage of or be 
detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier 
trade mark.

that, its use in India is liable to be prevented— 
 
(a)  by virtue of any law in particular the law of passing off 
protecting an unregistered trade mark used in the course of 
trade; or 
 
(b)  by virtue of law of copyright. 
 
(4)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the registration of a 
trade mark where the proprietor of the earlier trade mark  or 
other earlier right consents to the registration, and in such case 
the Registrar may register the mark under special circumstances 
under section 12.  
 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, earlier trade 
mark means— 
 
(a)  a registered trade mark  or an application under Section 
18 bearing an earlier date of filing or an international 
registration referred to in Section 36E or convention application 
referred to in section 154 which has a date of applicat ion earlier 
than that of the trade mark in question, taking account, where 
appropriate, of the priorities claimed in respect of the trade 
marks; 
 
(b) a trade mark which, on the date of the application fo r 
registration of the trade mark in question , or where 
appropriate, of the priority claimed in respect of the application, 
was entitled to protection as a well-known trade mark.” 
 
22. The Explanation to Section 11  of the Act as set out above makes it 
clear that for the purposes of Section 11 of the Act, the phrase „earlier trade 
mark‟ would apply only in respect of a registered trade mark. Admittedly, 
the trade mark of the petitioner company was not registered in India at the 
time registration was granted in fa vour of the respondent no.1 . Therefore, 
the petitioner company cannot take benefit of sub-Sections (1) and (2) of

Section 11 of the Act. Even the ground of passing of f under sub-Section (3) 
of Section 11 of the Act would not be available to the petitioner company as 
it has failed to make out a case of having goodwill and reputation in India in 
respect of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟.  
23. Counsel for the petitioner company contends that the respondent no.1 
has failed to prov ide any evidence in respect of its use of  the trade  mark 
„ALPHARD‟. The various invoices filed by respondent no.1 to show the 
user of the aforesaid trade mark is by another entity, „Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟. In this regard, it may be noted that in the present case , registration 
has been obtained by the respondent no.1 on a „proposed to be used basis‟, 
which is permissible under Section 18 of the Act. Therefore, user on the date 
of registration would not be a relevant factor.  The respondent no.1 has 
placed on record various photographs of it s products bearing the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ as also invoices of its sister company , „Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟ from 12th May, 2015 to 1st June, 2018 showing sales of products 
under the trade mark „ALPHARD‟.  Therefore, based  on the material on 
record, it cannot be established that the respondent no.1 has registered the 
trade mark without any bona fide intention to use the same.  
24. In view of the above, the petitioner company has completely failed to 
discharge the onus to show the reputation and goodwill of the mark 
„ALPHARD‟ in India . In fact, it  is not even the case of the petitioner 
company that it is dealing in products under Class 9 and Class 27 anywhere 
in the world. The documents placed on record by the petitioner company do  
not reflect extensive us e of the brand „ALPHARD‟ or establish that the 
brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired a transborder reputation in India in Classes 
9, 12 and 27. The evidence on record shows very limited sales and use of the

product in the Indian market and that too by private parti es. No 
advertisements have been made by the petitioner company in India. It cannot 
be stated that  a substantial number of consumers in India know about the 
existence of the brand „ALPHARD‟.  
25. Therefore, in my considered view, the petitioner company has fail ed 
to make out any ground for rectification of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
registered in Classes 9, 12 and 27 in the favour of the respondent no.1. I find 
no merit in the present rectification petitions filed on behalf of the petitioner 
company. Dismissed.

 / ‘INDIA GATE BRAND ’ in relation to ‘dalia’ 
and also came to know about the defend ant using the aforesaid trademark in 
respect of ‘dalia’.   
4. Accordingly, the present suit has been filed seeking, inter alia,  the 
relief of permanent injunction against the defendants. The suit was 
accompanied by the present application under Order XXXIX Ru les 1 and 2 
of the CPC seeking a grant of interim injunction.   Summons in the suit and 
notice in the application was issued on 21 st November, 2022. Pursuant 
thereto, written statement , as well as reply to the interim application , has 
been filed on behalf of the defendant.  
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF  
5. Counsel for the plaintiff has made the following submission. 
5.1 The user by the def endant of the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ in 
relation to ‘dalia’ is in violation of the order dated 21st April, 2014 passed by 
this co urt in FAO  no.7/2012. The defendant was permitted to use the 
trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ in respect of only ‘atta’, ‘suji’, ‘maida’, ‘rawa’ 
and ‘bran’, but not ‘dalia’. It is further submitted that the injunction granted 
against the defendant by the Trial Court  vide order dated 24th October, 2011 
in relation to goods other than ‘atta’, ‘suji’, ‘maida’, ‘rawa’ and ‘ bran’ was

not set aside and therefore, continues to operate.  
5.2 The invoices placed on record by the defendant showing user prior to 
the date of invoice of the plaintiff do not show that the defendant was selling 
its goods under the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’. 
5.3 The trademark registration application of the defendant in respect of 
‘dalia’ is still pending . Therefore, the aforesaid usage constitutes 
infringement of the registered and ‘well-known trademark’ of the plaintiff , 
‘INDIA GATE’.  
5.4 The impugned logo on the defendant ’s packaging is similar to the 
logo on the plaintiff ’s packaging and therefore,  constitutes infringement of 
the copyright of the plaintiff. 
5.5 The defendant is also guilty of passing off its goods as those of the 
plaintiff. 
5.6 Defendant has failed to make out a case of ‘continuous user’ in terms 
of Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Reliance in this regard has been 
placed on Pioneer Nuts and Bolt s Pvt. Ltd. v. Goodwill Enterprises, 2009 
SCC OnLine Del 2851, PEPS Industries (P) Ltd. v. Kurlon Ltd., 2022 SCC 
OnLine Del 3275 , Dabur India Ltd. v. Real Drinks Pvt. Ltd. , 2014 SCC

SUBMISSIONS OF THE DEFENDANT  
6. Per contra, the case of the defendant in the written statement and as 
per th e submissions made by the counsel for the defendant  can be 
summarized as under: 
6.1 The consent order dated 21 st April, 2014 is only in relation to ‘rice’

(plaintiff’s product) and ‘atta’, ‘ suji’, ‘ maida’, ‘ rawa’ and ‘ bran’ 
(defendant’s products) and not in relation to any other goods. Therefore, it 
was open for both the sides to expand their business to other products.  
6.2 The defendant is the prior user of the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ in 
respect of ‘atta’, ‘ suji’, ‘ maida’, ‘ rawa’ and ‘ bran’, which are all wheat 
products, since 1975. The defendant has an inherent right to expand its range 
of products and  hence, use the  aforesaid trademark in respect of ‘ dalia’, 
which is an allied/cognate product to the earlier products of the defendant. 
The defendant has been using the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ in respect of 
‘dalia’ since 2015, which the plaintiff was fully aware of. 
6.3 The plaintiff itself has filed various registration applications for the 
trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ in respect of  ‘rice flour’, ‘idli rava’, ‘rice atta’ 
and in respect of goods other than ‘rice’, such as ‘quinoa’, ‘flax seeds’ and 
‘millets’.  
6.4 As re gards the  trademark of the plaintiff being a ‘well-known 
trademark’, it is not based on any proper determination by the Court.  
6.5    Registration in respect of the plaintiff is defective as the trademark 
application was wrongly advertised as a word mark instead of a device mark 
as initially applied for. 
6.6 Counsel for the defendant has drawn the attention of the Court to 
copies of bills/invoices as well as advertisements in trade directories 
showing user of the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ by the defendant since 1990.

April, 2014 passed by this Court in FAO no.7/2012 and have sought to place 
their own interpretation of the same . Therefore, it is dee med expedient to 
extract the relevant portions of the said order: 
“1. Counsels for the parties, and who are veterans in IPR law, 
after some initial arguments, have agreed to dispose of these 
appeals with the following consent order:- 
 
(i) The appellant in FAO 7/12 i.e. KRBL Ltd., and who is the 
plaintiff in the trial court, will use the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ 
with respect to rice but not with respect to Aata, Suji, Maida, 
Rawa and Bran being presently used by the 
respondents/defendants, and all of which lat er products will be 
sold in packages of 20 kilograms and above by 
the  respondents/defendants. Any claim or entitlement of the 
respective  parties to use the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ for any 
other products except   as stated in this order, is not the subject 
matter of the present consent   order. The trademark ‘INDIA 
GATE’ will be used with respect to product   rice in packages of 
any size whatsoever by the appellant/plaintiff. 
 
(ii)  The respondents in FAO 7/2012, and who are defendants 
in the suits, without in  any manner comment being made upon 
their inter se disputes, will, so far as the appellant -plaintiff is 
concerned, be entitled to use the   trademark ‘INDIA GATE for 
their products being Aata, Maida, Rawa, Suzi  and Bran, for 
which a registration under the T rades Mark Act, 1999 exists  in 
their favour. Of course, observations with respect to registration 
is not being made in a final manner for or against any of the 
parties to the   appeal, and which aspect will be decided in 
appropriate legal proceedings.

5. It is again clarified that the observations in this appeal   and 
order are with res pect to use in the interim stages during 
the  pendency of the suit for the trademark „INDIA GATE ‟, and 
with respect to   the products which is stated above in the present 
order.

9. The position that emerges from a reading of the aforesaid order can be 
summarized as under: 
9.1 This was a consent order passed by the Court. 
9.2 The plaintiff was restrained from using the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ 
in respect of the following products viz, ‘atta’, ‘suji’, ‘ maida’, ‘ rawa’ and 
‘bran’, that were being used at that point of time by the defendant. 
9.3 The defendant could not use the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ in respect 
of ‘rice’. 
9.4 Plaintiff was permitted to use the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ in 
respect of ‘rice’ in packages of any size. The defendant could sell ‘atta’, 
‘suji’, ‘maida’, ‘rawa’ and ‘bran’ in packages of 20 kg and above. 
9.5 The entitlement of parties to use the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ 
for any other products other than the aforenoted products , was not 
covered by the said order. 
9.6 This arrangement was to continue till the final disposal of the suit.  
10. A reading of the aforesaid order makes it clear that there was no bar 
either on the plaintiff or on the defendant to use the trademark ‘INDIA

GATE’ in respect of products other than those that were the subject matter 
of the said suit i.e., ‘atta’, ‘suji’, ‘maida’, ‘rawa’, ‘bran’ and ‘rice’.   
11. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that since the aforesaid order did not 
set aside the order passed by the Trial Court on 24 th October, 2011 , 
restraining the defendant from use of the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’  along 
with the label or device of INDIA GATE  in respect of products other than 
the products that were registered by the defendant . The said restraint order 
would continue to operate even after passing of the aforesaid consent order. 
12. I do not agree with the aforesaid submission of the plaintiff .  The 
observations made in paragraph 14 of the order dated 24 th October, 2011, 
which was the subject matter of appeal in FAO no. 7/2012, restraining the 
defendants from using the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ along with the label or 
device of INDIA GATE in respect of any product other than ‘atta’, ‘suji’, 
‘maida’, ‘rawa’ and ‘ bran’, would not operate after the c onsent order dated 
21st April, 2014 was passed by this Court.  Once a comprehensive consen t 
order has been passed by the Appellate Court clearly defining  the inter se 
arrangement between the plaintiff and the defendant during the pendency of 
the suit, no reliance can be placed on the order of the Trial Court, which is 
deemed to have merged with the order passed by the Appellate Court. 
Therefore, there is no merit in the submission that the consent order did not 
specifically set aside the order of the Trial Court and only partially modified 
the said order.   
13. After passing of the aforesaid consent order, the plaintiff filed various 
trademark registration applications in Class 30 in respect of ‘rice flour’, ‘idli 
rava’, ‘rice atta’ and goods other than ‘rice’, such as ‘quinoa’, ‘flaxseeds’,

‘millets’, etc. However, no trademark registration application has been filed 
by the plaintiff for ‘dalia’. 
14. Surely, if the plaintiff has a right to expand the usage of its trademark 
‘INDIA GATE’ in respect of other ‘rice’ products and products beyond 
‘rice’, the defendant cannot be denied the same right to expand its business 
into other allied/cognate products. The present case relates to ‘ dalia’, which 
would fall in the category of wheat product s. Pertinently, the defendant is 
not using the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ in respect of ‘rice’ or ‘rice’ 
products. I do not r ead any restriction in the consent order  either on the 
plaintiff or the defendant from expanding their business into other products. 
Therefore, in my considered view, the defendant was entitled to expand its 
product range into similar or cognate or allied goods and use the trademark 
‘INDIA GATE’ in respect of such goods, including ‘dalia’. In this regard 
counsel for defendant has correctly placed reliance on the judgment of a Co -
ordinate Bench of this Court in  Somany Ceramics Ltd. v. Shri Ganesh 
Electric Co., 2022 SCC OnLine Del 3270.  The relevant paragraph is set out 
below: 
“61. Pertinent it is to mention, at this stage, that while the 
Plaintiff started its business in ceramics tiles, it subsequently 
expanded into sanitaryware and bath fittings and obtained  
registrations in Class 11 on 05.01.2007. Later, Plaintiff also 
expanded its business into selling water heaters/geysers and 
obtained registration on 31.07.2018. This fact is important in the 
context of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Laxmikant 
(supra), where it was held that Courts have to be mindful of 
future expansion of the business of a proprietor of a trademark. 
Plaintiff is right in its contention that merely because a 
trademark registration is applied for in a particular class, the 
proprietor i s forever bound to sell only those goods. Law 
recognises the expansion of business into similar or cognate or

allied goods and this factor is relevant for determination of a 
claim for passing off.” 
 
15. It has been vehemently contended on behalf of the plainti ff that the 
defendant ha s failed to file invoices showing that the products of the 
defendant were sold under the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’. Therefore, the 
defendant cannot claim user  prior to the registration of the plaintiff. In this 
regard, reference may b e made to the invoices placed on record by the 
defendant beginning from 8 th May, 1990 (pages no. 44 to 189 of the 
defendant’s documents) which show the use of the ‘INDIA GATE’ device 
mark and the word mark. While it is correct that some of the invoices for the 
earlier period do not show that the goods were being sold under the 
trademark ‘INDIA GATE’, in all the aforesaid invoices the device of INDIA 
GATE prominently features at the top left corner of the invoices. Defendant 
has also placed on record the adv ertisements made by the defendant in 
various trade directories with effect from May, 1990 (pages no. 325 to 339 
of the defendant’s documents) to show that the defendant w as continuously 
using the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ in respect of their wheat products. 
16. For a prima facie  consideration, the defendant ha s placed sufficient 
material on record showing user of the ‘INDIA GATE’ device mark from 
1990, which is prior to the registration of  the plaintiff.  To be noted, the 
registration granted in favour of the plaintiff was only in respect of ‘rice’.  
The earliest invoice filed on behalf of the plaintiff showing user of the 
trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ is of 18th February, 1995.  
17. It has also to be borne in mind that the defendant was granted 
registration in respect of the d evice mark ‘INDIA GATE’ with effect from 
3rd November, 1993. In this regard reference may be made to the judgment

in Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. v. Coca Cola Co. , (1995) 5 SCC 545 followed 
by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court  in Aditya Birla Nuvo Limited v. R.S. 
Sales Corporation, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 9794 , wherein it has been held 
that a mark which is registered is protected, irrespective of the fact whether 
the party uses the registered mark or not.  
18. The undertaking given on behalf of the defendant in the re ctification 
petition filed by the plaintiff was only in respect of the earlier suit that was 
pending before the Patiala  House Courts, New Delhi . The said undertaking  
cannot be applied to the present suit.  
19. Reliance placed on behalf of the plaintiff on the judgments in Pioneer 
Nuts and Bolts Pvt. Ltd. v. Goodwill Enterprises, 2009 SCC OnLine Del 
2851, PEPS Industries (P) Ltd.  v. Kurlon Ltd. , 2022 SCC OnLine Del

and S. Narendra Kumar & Co. v. Everest Beverages and Foods Inudstries, 
2008 SCC OnLine Del 1759 , would not come to the assistance of the 
plaintiff as in all the aforesaid cases, unlike the present case, there was no 
registration of the trademark in favour of the defendant. 
20. Much emphasis has been laid on behalf of the plaintiff on the aspect 
that the trademark of the plaintiff is a ‘well-known trademark’ in terms of 
Section 2(1)(zg) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. In this regard, reliance has 
been placed on the order dated 31 st July, 2 019 passed by the Deputy 
Registrar of Trade Marks, declaring the trademark of the plaintiff, ‘INDIA 
GATE’ as a ‘well-known trademark ’. However, a perusal of the aforesaid 
order shows that the aforesaid determination was made by the Deputy 
Registrar based on an order dated 10 th May, 2016 passed by the Additional 
District Judge, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi in ex parte proceedings.  It

is pertinent to note that neither any prayer was sought nor any issue was 
framed with regard to the trademark of the plain tiff being a ‘well-known 
trademark’. The plaintiff cannot take advantage of the aforesaid 
determination of its trademark being a ‘well-known trademark ’ so as to 
prevent the defendant from using the said trademark in respect of which the 
defendant has  prior user and registration. In terms of Section 28(3) of the 
Trade Marks Act, 1999, where two persons are registered proprietors of 
identical or similar trademarks both shall have the exclusive right to use the 
said trademarks. 
21. It is significant to note that t he defendant applied for the registration 
of the device mark ‘INDIA GATE’ in respect of ‘dalia’ on 5th October, 2021 
claiming user since 1st April, 2015. The defendant has also placed on record 
invoices from 8 th October, 2015 (pages no. 291-322 of the defen dant’s 
documents) showing sale of ‘dalia’ under the trademark ‘INDIA GATE  
BRAND’, which is much prior to filing of the present suit.  
22. As regards the infringement of the plaintiff ’s registered copyright by 
the defendant, it is to be noted that the earliest copyright registration in 
favour of the plaintiff is in 1999, which is much after the user of the artistic 
device of 
  by the defendant. The pictorial depiction of INDIA 
GATE is substantially different in the label of the plaintiff and the label of 
the defendant. Therefore, no case for copyright infringement is made out.

23. As regards the allegations of passing off, in paragraph 36 of the plaint 
at page no.52, a comparison of the trademark ‘INDIA GATE’ of the plaintiff 
and the defendant has been made, which is set out below: 
 
24.  The aforesaid  comparison shows that there is  a material difference 
between the packaging of the plaintiff and the defendant . Even though the 
words ‘INDIA GATE ’ and the pictori al representation of INDIA GATE  
occur in both the packaging o f the p laintiff and the def endant, the getup of 
the packaging is substantially different, so th ere can be no possibility of 
confusion or deception to the public . Reference in this regard may be made 
to the judgment of a Co -ordinate Bench of this Court in  Laxmi Agro Impex 
India v. Ladli India Commodities, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11147, wherein it 
has been held that the rival marks have to be compared as a whole, keeping

preferred thereagainst was dismissed on 16th October, 2020.  
25. In view of the discuss ion above, the plaintiff has failed to establish a 
prima facie case in its favour for the grant of interim injunction. Balance of 
convenience is also in favour of the defendant for not granting interim 
injunction at this stage , as the product ‘dalia’ of th e defendant ha s been 
selling in the market with the impugned trademark since 2015.  There is no 
merit in the present application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the 
CPC.  
26. Dismissed.

I.A. 1464/2018 (O-XI R-5 of the CPC) 
1. The present application has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff under 
Order XI Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 (CPC)  as applicable 
to commercial suits under the Commercial Courts Act,  2015 for placing on 
record additional documents.  
2. Reply has been filed on behalf of the defendants opposing the  present 
application. Rejoinder thereto, has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff.  
3. It is the case of the plaintiff  that the aforesaid additional documents 
were filed by the plaintiff on 17 th October, 2017 on the same date as the

replication. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the filing of the aforesaid 
documents was necessitated on account of the statement made o n behalf of 
the defendants, as noted in the o rder dated 26 th September, 2017, that the 
defendant no.1 was not in existence at the time of the filing of the present 
suit and some of the  additional documents sought to be filed  are to  
demonstrate that the defendant no.1 was in existence at the time of filing of 
the present suit. 
4. Yet another justification given on behalf of the plaintiff for filing 
additional documents is to demonstrate the contrary stand s taken by the 
defendants in their written statement s and in the replies to the examination 
reports of the Registry . It is stated that in the written statement s the 
defendants have taken a stand that the trademarks/taglines, which are the 
subject matter of the present suit are descriptive and generic in nature. 
However, in various replies to the examination reports of the Registry, the 
defendants have taken a contrary stand. Therefore, it is necessary to place 
the aforesaid documents on record. Reliance is placed on Order XI Rule (1) 
(c)(ii) of the CPC.  
5. Per cont ra, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the defendants 
submits that since the defendant no.1 has already been deleted from the 
array of parties , the documents with regard to the defendant no.1 are no 
longer relevant  in the present suit . It is further sub mitted that there is no 
contradiction in the stand taken by the defendant s before the Trade  Mark 
Registry and the written statement filed in the present suit. It is also 
contended that the documents now sought to be filed were in the power, 
possession, control and custody  of the plaintiff at the time of filing of the 
present suit and therefore, ought to have been filed along with the  suit.

Reliance is being placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sudhir 
Kumar v. Vinay Kumar, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 734 and the judgment of a 
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Nitin Gupta v. Taxmaco Infrastructure 
& Holding Ltd., 2019 SCC OnLine Del 8367.  
6. I have heard the counsel for the parties.  
7. A perusal of the additional documents sought to be placed on record 
by the pl aintiff would show that the said documents are the examination 
reports of the Registry and the responses thereto by the defendants. All the 
aforesaid documents pertain to the defendants.  Attention of the C ourt has 
been drawn by the counsel for the plaintif f to paragraph 18 of the written 
statement filed by the defendant no.2 , where a specific stand has been taken 
by the defendants that the trademark/taglines, which are the subject matter 
of the present suit are descriptive in nature. The aforesaid contentio n has 
been rebutted by the plaintiff in its replication. In order to meet the aforesaid 
contention of the defendants, the plaintiff seeks to place on record the 
aforesaid documents to show that in their replies to the examination reports, 
the defendants have claimed the  trademark to be distinctive. The aforesaid 
documents are covered within the ambit of sub -rule (1)(c)(ii) of Rule (1) of 
Order XI of the CPC in terms of which the plaintiff would be entitled to file 
the documents in response to a case set up by the defendant s after filing of 
the plaint. Therefore, there is no merit in the submission of the defendants 
that the aforesaid documents were available in public domain and could 
have been filed along with the plaint. Even if the said documents were 
available in public domain at the time of filing of the suit, the need for filing 
the aforesaid documents arose only on account of the stand taken by the 
defendants in the written statement.

8. Insofar as the objection of the defendants that the documents in 
respect of the defendant no.1 are not relevant as the defendant no.1 has been 
deleted from the array of the parties, it is the contention of the plaintiff that 
despite the defendants claiming that the defendant no.1 was not in existence, 
certain replies were  filed on behalf of the defendant no.1 before the Trade  
Mark Registry.  Therefore, the aforesaid documents are relevant for  
determining whether an incorrect stand has been taken by the defendant or 
not.   
9. In Sudhir Kumar (supra), relied upon by the defendants, the Supreme 
Court was dealing with the provisions of Order XI Rule 1(4) read with Order 
XI Rule 1(5) of the CPC in respect of filing additional documents after filing 
of the plaint in case of urgent listings. It was further observed that the rigour 
of establishing reasonable cause  for non-disclosure of the documents along 
with the plaint may not arise in case s where additional documents are 
discovered subsequent to filing of the plaint. The aforesaid judgment does 
not in any manner curtail the power of the Court to permit additional 
documents to be taken on record if a party gives sufficient cause for not 
filing the said documents along with the plaint.  
10. The judgment in Nitin Gupta  (supra) relied upon by the defendants 
has been distinguished in other judgments of the Co-ordinate Benches of this 
Court in Hassad Food Company Q.S.C.  v. Bank of India , 2019 SCC 
OnLine Del 10647  and Mahesh Chaudhri  v. IMV India Pvt. Ltd. , 2019 
SCC OnLine Del 9813  on the ground that the issues in the said suit had 
already been framed and the documents were inconsistent with the pleadings 
in the suit . In both the aforesaid cases, the additional documents were

allowed to be taken on record on the ground that the issues were yet to be 
framed in the suit and additional documents soug ht to be filed by the 
plaintiff were relevant for the adjudication of the case.  
11. The judgments in Hassad Food Company (supra), Mahesh 
Chaudhri  (supra) and Nitin Gupta (supra) were considered by me in 
Khurmi Associates (P) Ltd.  v. Maharishi Dayanand Co -Operative Group 
Housing Society, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 1011. Relying upon the judgments 
in Hassad Food Company (supra) and Mahesh Chaudhary  (supra), the 
additional documents were permitted to be taken on record on the ground 
that issues were yet to be framed in  the suit and the documents were in 
support of the pleadings of the plaintiff company.  
12. The facts in the present case are very similar to the facts in Khurmi 
Associates (supra). Issues are yet to be framed in the suit. It is an admitted 
position that the a dditional documents were filed on behalf of the plaintiff 
on the same date as the  replication. A perusal of the pleadings in the suit 
would also show that the aforesaid documents sought to be filed are not 
contrary to the pleadings of the plaintiff in the suit. In my considered view , 
the aforesaid documents would be  relevant for the adjudication of the 
present suit.  
13. Accordingly, the present application is allowed and the plaintiff is 
permitted to place the additional documents on record, subject to payment of 
costs of Rs.20,000/- to the defendants.

2.1 The plaintiff, M/s RPG Enterprises Limited is an Indian industrial 
conglomerate comprising of over twenty companies in the area of 
infrastructure, tyres, technology and speciality.  
2.2 The plaintiff has been has been using the „RPG‟ word mark since 
1979. 
2.3 The plaintiff is the proprietor of the registered trademark „RPG‟ , 
, 
   and other related marks in Classes 5, 
9, 12, 16 and 30 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The said marks have come to 
be exclusively associated with the plaintiff. Details of the trademark 
registrations of the plaintiff‟s „RPG‟ marks have been tabulated in paragraph 
5 of the plaint. 
2.4 The said marks of the plaintiff are  also registered by the plai ntiff in 
various foreign countries, details of which have been provided in paragraph 
6 of the plaint. 
2.5 The plaintiff‟s „RPG‟ marks have acquired the status of well -known 
trademarks within the meaning of Section 2(1)(zg) of the Trade Marks Act, 
1999, which fact is recognised in the judgment of RPG Enterprises Limited

2.8 Sometime in August, 2017, the plaintiff came across the infringing 
activities of the d efendants. The defendants are deliberately using the trade 
name „M/s RPG Developers‟ with an intent to misrepresent to the public that 
the defendants are associated with the plaintiff as an associate/joint 
venture/group company. The defendants have adopted  the „RPG‟ mark and 
are using the mark 
 . 
2.9 The defendants ‟ website mentions  various projects  using the word 
mark „RPG‟  titled as „RPG Sathya Nagar, ‟ „RPG Metro City, ‟ „RPG Vel 
Nagar,‟ „RPG Global City,‟ „RPG Metro City,‟ „RPG Swarna Boomi,‟ „RPG 
Aravindar City‟ and „RPG Rokkisha Bhoomi.‟  
2.10 Plaintiff issued cease and desist notices dated 10th August, 2017 to the 
defendants, inter alia, calling upon the defendants to stop selling/offering for 
sale their projects  under the mark „RPG‟ , recall their finished infri nging 
goods/promotional materials and give an undertaking to the effect that they 
shall not infringe the marks of the plaintiff in the future . However, despite 
service, no reply to the said letters has been received by the plaintiff.  
3. Accordingly, the plaintiff filed the present suit seeking to restrain the 
defendants from carrying on their infringing activities.  
PROCEEDINGS IN THE SUIT 
4. This Court, vide order dated 10th January, 2018 granted an ex parte ad 
interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff  under I.A. 364/2018, retraining 
the defendants from using the mark „RPG‟. The relevant portion of the said 
order is as under:

“Keeping in view the aforesaid, this Court is of the 
opinion that a prima facie case of infringement and passing off is 
made out in favour of the plaintiff and balance of convenience is 
also in its favour. Further, irreparable harm or injury would be 
caused to the plaintiff if an interim injunction order is not 
passed.  
Consequently, till further orders, the defendants, 
directors/proprietors/partners, their principals, employees, 
agents, distributors, franchisees, representatives and assigns 
are restrained from giving any services, in any manner 
whatsoever and/or using the registered trademark RPG and/or 
RPG Developers and/or artistic wor k which is a colourable 
imitation of the plaintiff‟s artistic work or any other 
trademark/artistic work confusingly similar to the registered 
trade mark/copyright of the plaintiff.” 
5. The matter was thereafter placed before the Joint Registrar for 
effecting service and completion of pleadings. 
6. Even though the defendant no.4 was served through ordinary mode on 
17th February, 2018, none appeared for the defendant no.4 on 16 th March, 
2018, 9th May, 2018 and 15 th May, 2018. Further, no written statement was 
filed on behalf of the defendant no.4. Consequently, the defendant no.4 was 
proceeded against ex parte on 15th May, 2018. 
7. Fresh service of s ummons was directed for  the defendants no.1 to 3 
and 5 on 3rd March, 2020 and 22nd September, 2021  
8. On 12th January, 2022, the counsel for the plaintiff submitted that all 
the defendants, with the exception of the defendant no.4, have been duly 
served and that an affidavit of service has also been filed in this regard. 
9. Thereafter, vide order dated 6 th July, 2022 passed by th e Joint 
Registrar, the defendants no.1 to 3 and 5 were deemed to be served  on the 
basis of the affidavit of service filed on behalf of the plaintiff.

10. On 6th December, 2022 , the Joint Registrar  closed the right of the 
defendants no.1 to 3 and 5 to file wri tten statement and the matter was 
placed before the Court.  
11. In view of the above, the counsel for the plaintiff prays for a decree of 
permanent injunction and damages along with costs in the suit. 
ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS  
12. I have heard the counsel for the plai ntiff and perused the record of the 
case. 
13. At the outset, it may be relevant to note that the defendants no.1 to 3 
and 5 has been served through speed post, courier and email. Despite this, 
the defendants no.1 to  3 and 5 have chosen not to enter appearance.  The 
defendant no.4 has also been proceeded against ex parte on 15th May, 2018. 
Ample opportunity has been given to the defendants to appear before the 
Court and defend the case. 
14. Since the defendants have failed to enter appearance or even take any 
steps r equisite to contest the present suit, despite having suffered an ad 
interim injunction order, it is evident that they have no defence to put forth 
on merits.  
15. At this stage, it may be relevant to note the comparison between the 
marks of the plaintiff and the defendants, which is as under:

16. From a perusal of the competing marks above, this Court is of the 
view that the defendants‟ use of the „RPG‟ marks is nothing but an attempt 
to ride on the goodwill and reputation o f the plaintiff‟s  well-known 
trademarks. This is further eviden ced from the prominent use of the  marks 
„RPG‟/ 
  on the defendants‟ website  
“www.rpgdevelopers.in”, screenshots of which have been annexed at pages  
45 to 47 of the documents filed along with the plaint. 
17. Based on the averments in the plaint and the discussion above , this 
Court is of the view that this is  a fit case for granting relief of permanent 
injunction. The defendants  are restrained from  offering/rendering any 
services using the impugned trademark „RPG‟ and/or „RPG DEVELOPERS‟ 
and/or artistic work which is a colourable imitation of the plaintiff‟s artistic  
work or any other trademark/artistic work  deceptively similar to the „RPG‟ 
marks of the plaintiff. 
18. Accordingly, the present suit is decreed in terms of prayer clauses „a.‟, 
„b.‟ and „c.‟ of the plaint.  
19. At this stage, counsel for the plaintiff does not press for the relief s 
contemplated in prayer clauses „d.‟ and „e.‟ of the plaint. 
20. Insofar as t he relief of damages as sought in prayer clause „ f.‟ is 
concerned, the defendants are trading under the name „M/s RPG 
DEVELOPERS‟ in order to dupe the general public into believing that the 
defendants are a subsidiary/group company/joint venture of the pla intiff, 
which is a reputed industrial conglomerate in the business of infrastructure . 
Projects of the defendants are being listed on their website using the „RPG‟

mark of the plaintiff. The defendants have also failed to respond to the legal 
notices dated 10th August, 2017 sent to them on behalf of the plaintiff, 
requiring them to cease and desist from their use of the „RPG‟ mark of the 
plaintiff. Moreover, the defendants have also chosen to stay away from the 
present proceedings, despite service. 
21. In view of the foregoing facts and circumstances, this Court is of the 
view that this is not a case of innocent adoption. The Court cannot ignore 
such flagrant misuse of the plaintiff‟s marks by the defendants . Therefore, 
considering the dishonest conduct of the de fendant, the suit is decreed in 
favour of the plaintiff for Rs.3,00,000/ - as damages. Additionally, 
Rs.3,00,000/- is awarded to the plaintiff as costs  to be paid by the 
defendants. 
22. The defendants shall pay the said amount to the plaintiff within eight 
weeks, failing which the plaintiff is permitted to commence execution 
proceedings against the defendants. 
23. All pending applications are disposed of. 
24. Decree sheet be drawn up.

‘DAVIDOFF’ and other related marks  of the plaint iff in Classes 3, 33 and 
25 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, details of which are provided in paragraph 
8 of the plaint.  The said marks of the plaintiff are also registe red by the 
plaintiff in various foreign countries.  
2.4        The goods of the plaintiffs are sold in more than 100 countries of the 
world including India. The plaintiff’s trademark ‘DAVIDOFF’ has acquired 
vast goodwill and reputation all over the world i ncluding India. The 
trademark ‘DAVIDOFF’ of the p laintiff has come to be exclusively 
associated with the plaintiff. 
2.5      The trademark ‘DAVIDOFF’ has also been adopted by the plaintiff in 
respect of its domain name www.zinodavidoff.com. The plaintiff has been 
using the said domain name in relation to its goods and businesses.  
2.6       In April, 2015, the plaintiff came ac ross the infringing activit ies of 
the defendants. The defendants no.1 and 2 are conducting their business of 
selling counterfeit perfumes and fragrances bearing the plaintiff’s trademark

defendant no.3, www.shopclues.com.  
2.7    The packaging of the impugned pro ducts purchased by the plaintiff 
through the aforesaid website does not contain the names of the dis tributer 
and manufacturer, which indicates t hat the impugned products sold through 
the said website are counterfeit products.  
2.8     The plaintiff issued cease and desist notice to the def endants on 30 th 
April, 2015 calling upon the defendants to re frain from selling, displaying, 
advertising or offering for sale products bearing the plaintiff ’s trademark

said notice vide letters dated 13 th May, 2015 and 27 th May, 2015 
respectively. In its reply, the defen dant no.2 pleaded ignorance on the 
counterfeit nature of the impugned products and undertook to re frain from 
dealing with the impugned products  in future . T he defendant no.3 in its 
reply denied its involvement in the infringement activities undertaken by the 
defendants no.1 and 2.  
3. Accordingly, the plaintiff has filed the present suit.  
PROCEEDINGS IN THE SUIT 
4. This court , vide orde r dated 15th July, 2015 , granted ex parte ad 
interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff under I.A. 13923/2015 , 
restraining the defendant s from selling impugned products un der the 
trademark ‘DAVIDOFF’. The relevant portion of the said order is set out as 
under:  
           “I have heard the contentions of learned counsel for the plaintiff and 
 perused the plaint along with documents annexed therewith and am   
of the  view that plaintiff has disclosed a, prima facie, case in its 
favour for grant of ex-parte injunction. In case the defendants are not 
restrained from selli ng the  counterfeit products under the mark 
'DAVIDOFF', plaintiff shall suffer  irreparable lo ss and injury, 
inasmuch as, balance of convenience is also in  favour of the plaintiff 
and against the defendants. Accordingly, till next date  of hearing, 
defendants are restrained from selling the goods more  particularly 
perfumes and fragrances under the m ark 'DAVIDOFF' or any  
deceptively similar mark as that of the plaintiff, in any manner, 
including through the website www.shopclues.com.” 
 
5. The matter was thereafter placed before the Joint Registrar on 7 th 
October, 2015 for effecting  service and completion of pleadings . Counsel 
appeared on behalf of the defendant no. 3  on the said date . The defendants 
no.1 and 2 cou ld n ot be serv ed despite repeated attempts. U ltimately, the

October, 2015 and the replication thereto was filed by the plaintiff.  Order 
dated 30th January, 2017  records the unde rtaking of  the defendant no.3 to 
take down any existing listing with regard to the mark ‘ZINO DAVIDOFF’ 
within 72 hours and any other listing as and when identified by the plaintiff.  
7. On 16th November, 2017, the defendants no.1 and 2 were pro ceeded 
against ex parte in the present suit.  
8. On 1st March, 2018, the following issues were framed:

as provided under Section 2(1)(w) of the Information Technology Act, 
2000 is maintainable or not? OPD 
 
2.Whether the defendant no. 3 had 'actual knowledge' of the allegedly 
infringing nature of the goods listed by defendant nos. 1 and 2 on its 
website www.shopclues.com and if so, how the knowledge mandated 
by Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 was  
satisfied to render the defendants liable? OPP 
 
3. Whether the defendants had conspired or  abetted or aided or 
induced, whether by threats or promise or otherwise in the 
commission of the acts of passing off and/or infringement by  
defendant nos. 1 and 2? OPP 
 
          4. Relief. 
9. On 10 th April, 2 019, the matter was referr ed for mediation  and the 
matter was set tled vide  Settlement Agreement dated 5 th December, 2022

the settlement are confidential. 
10. In view of the above, the counsel for the plaintiff prays for a decree of 
permanent injunction and damages along with costs in the suit  against the 
defendants no.1 and 2  and a decree in terms of the Settlement Agreement 
against the defendant no.3.  
ANALYSIS AND FINDING  
11. I have heard the coun sel for the plaintiff and the defendant no.3 and 
perused the record of the case. 
12.  In the present case , the defendants no.1 and 2 ha ve failed to appear 
before this Court despite service. Therefore, the defendants no.1 and 2 have 
been proceeded against ex parte on 16th November, 2017.  
13.  Since the aforesaid defendants have failed to enter appearance or 
even take any requisite steps to contest the present suit, despite having 
suffered an ad interim injunction order, it is evident that they have no 
defence to put forth on merits. 
14.  From a perusal of the material on record , this Court is of the view 
that the defendants no.1 and 2 have been selling impugned products with a 
view to trade upon the established goodwill and reputation  of the plaintiff . 
By their aforesai d conduct, the defendant s no.1 and 2  are infringing the 
trademarks of the plaintiff , as also passing off their goods as that of the 
plaintiff.  
15.  Based on the averments in the plaint and the discussion above, this 
Court is of the view that this is a fit cas e for granting relief of permanent 
injunction in favour of the plaint iff and against the defendants no. 1 and 2 . 
Accordingly, the defendants no.1 and 2  are restrained from manufacturing 
and selling counterfeit products bearing  the plaintiff ’s trademark

‘DAVIDOFF’ or any other trademark  deceptively similar to the 
‘DAVIDOFF’ marks of the plaintiff on the website, www.shopclues.com, or 
any other website  in relation to the business of perfumes, fragrances and 
related products.   
16. In so far as the reliefs of damages and cost prayed for in the plaint, the 
defendant no.2 has given an undertaking not to deal with  the impugned  
products vide reply dated 13th May, 2015 to the cease and desist notice. In 
my considered view, it is not the case of the plaintiff that after the aforesaid 
reply, t he defendant no .2 continued to sell the impugned products. 
Therefore, I do not deem it proper to award damages and costs against the 
defendant no.2.    
17. As regards defendant  no.1, the defendant n o.1 neither repl ied to the 
legal notice, nor appeared before this Court. There can be no justification for 
manufacturing and selling perfumes and fragrances in counterfeit 
‘DAVIDOFF’ branded packaging. The use of the impugned products on 
human b ody can cau se adverse reactions . Clearly, customers are being 
misled by the defendants no.1  and the entire eff ort is deliberate  and 
dishonest. This amounts to dilution of  the reputation and goodwill of the 
plaintiff’s trademarks and caus ing loss to the plaintiff in b usiness and 
reputation. The defendant no.1 has been  making unlawful gain s at the 
expense of the plaintiff.  
18. In view of the foregoing facts and circumstances, this Court is o f the 
view that this is not a case of innocent adoption  by the defendant no.1 . The 
Court cannot ignore such flagrant misuse of the plaintif f’s marks by the 
defendant no.1. Therefore, the suit is decreed in favour of the plaintiff for 
Rs.3,00,000/- towards damages to be paid by the defen dant no.1.

Additionally, Rs.2,00,000/- is awarded to the plaintiff as costs to be paid by 
the defendant no.1.  
19. The defendants no.1 shall pay the said amount to the plaintiff within 
eight weeks, failing which the plaintiff is permitted to comme nce execution 
proceedings against the defendant no.1.  
20. Accordingly, the present suit is decreed  against the defendant no.1 in 
terms of prayer clauses  ‘a’, ‘e’ and ‘g’ of the plaint  and against the 
defendant no.2 in terms of prayer clause ‘a’ of the plaint.   
21. Counsel for the plaintiff does not press for the reliefs conte mplated in 
prayer clauses ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’ and ‘f’ of the plaint  against the defendants no.1 
and 2. 
22. Insofar as the defendant no.3 is concerned, the suit is decreed against 
the defendant no.3  in terms of the Settlement Agreement dated 5 th 
December, 2022. The s aid Settlement agreement shall form part of the 
decree.  
23.     Decree sheet be drawn up. 
24.     All pending applications stand disposed of.

1. The present suit has been filed seeking relief of permanent injunction
restraining the defendant from infringing the trademark of the plaintiff,
passing off his goods as that of the plaintiff, damages and other ancillary
reliefs.
2. Summons in the suit were issued on 17 th January, 2022, when this
Court granted ex parte ad interim injunction against the defendant
restraining him from using the impugned mark ‘SHAN E DELHI’, ‘SHAN-
A-DELHI’ or any other mark identical or deceptively similar to the

plaintiff’s trademark, ‘SHAN-E-DELHI’ /
 . A
Local Commissioner was also appointed by this Court to seize and
inventorize the infringing goods. Vide order dated 2 nd February, 2022 one
more Local Commissioner was appointed to visit another premises of the
defendant.
3. The counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant entered appearance
on 26 th April, 2022 and the Court directed for the written statement along
with an affidavit of admission/denial of documents to be filed within the
period permissible in law. The replication was directed to be filed within
fifteen days of the receipt of the written statement.
4. The written statement was filed on behalf of the defendant on 26 th
April, 2022 and copy of the same was supplied to the counsel for the
plaintiff on the same date. The written statement was filed belatedly and
therefore, it was accompanied by an application under Order VIII Rule 1 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) seeking condonation of delay of
27 days in filing the written statement.
5. The aforesaid application was allowed by the Joint Registrar on 11 th
July, 2022 while noting that the counsel for the plaintiff does not have any
objection to the same. Subsequently, replication was filed on behalf of the
plaintiff on 23rd July, 2022.
6. Counsel for the defendant contends that the replication cannot be

taken on record as it was filed beyond the maximum permissible period of
45 days from the date when the written statement was supplied to the
plaintiff. He places reliance on Chapter VII Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court
(Original Side) Rules, 2018 (hereinafter ‘Delhi High Court (OS) Rules’), the
judgment of the Division Bench in Ram Sarup Lugani v. Nirmal Lugani,
2020 SCC OnLine Del 1353 and the judgment of a Co-ordinate Bench in
Atlanta Limited v. National Highways & Infrastructure Development
Corporation Limited, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11276.
7. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the copy of the written statement
was supplied to him only on 17 th May, 2022. The time for counting the
period for filing replication can only be counted from the date when the
written statement was permitted to be taken on record. In the present case,
the said date would be 11 th July, 2022. He further submits that the aforesaid
judgments relied upon by the defendant are not applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the case.
8. I have heard the counsels for the parties.
9. To appreciate the submissions of the parties, a reference may be made
to the relevant portion of Chapter VII Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court (OS)
Rules, which is reproduced below:
“5. Replication. – The replication, if any, shall be filed within
30 days of receipt of the written statement. …”
10. The Division Bench in Ram Sarup Lugani (supra) while considering
the aforesaid Rule came to the conclusion that the Rule 5 of the Delhi High
Court (OS) Rules is mandatory in nature and the replication cannot be
permitted to be taken on record after the exhaustion of the maximum
prescribed period of 45 days. The issue before the Division Bench was not

CS(COMM) 34/2022 Page 4 of 6
with regard to the date from which the period of 45 days for filing the
replication would begin. The issue before the Division Bench was in the
context of whether delay in filing the replication can be condoned beyond
the period of 45 days in terms of Rule 5 of Chapter VII of the Delhi High
Court (OS) Rules. Therefore, the observations of the Division Bench would
not be of any assistance to the defendant.
11. I do not agree with the submission of the defendant that in all cases
the period for filing replication would commence from the date of written
statement being supplied by the defendant to the plaintiff in terms of Rule 5
of the Delhi High Court (OS) Rules. Undoubtedly, the language used in
Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court (OS) Rules is that the replication has to be
filed within 30 days from the receipt of the written statement. This may be
ordinarily so. However, where the written statement was filed beyond the
statutory time limit and was taken on record only upon an application for
condonation of delay being allowed by the Court, the aforesaid rule has to
be interpreted in a manner that the period of 30 days will begin from the
time the written statement is permitted to be taken on record.
12. This issue may be examined from a different point of view as well.
There would be no requirement for the plaintiff to file a replication in the
event that the application seeking condonation of delay in filing written
statement is not allowed and the written statement is not taken on record.
The plaintiff would be required to file replication only once the condonation
in delay is allowed and the written statement is taken on record. Therefore, it
is axiomatic that the period for filing replication would only commence from
the date when the delay is condoned and the written statement is taken on
record.

13. In the present case, the replication was filed by the plaintiff within 12
days after the written statement was taken on record. It was the defendant
who had filed the written statement in a belated manner and sought
condonation of delay for the same, which the counsel for the plaintiff fairly
did not oppose. Therefore, there is no basis for the defendant to object to the
replication being taken on record.
14. Reliance has been placed by the counsel for the defendant on the
judgment in Atlanta Limited (supra). In the said case, the written statement
was already taken on record and the plaintiff had filed an application under
the provisions of Order VIII Rule 10 of the CPC for taking the written
statement off the record as the filing of the written statement was delayed
and the said application was dismissed. The counsel for the plaintiff therein
filed an application contending that the maximum permissible period of 45
days for filing replication should be counted from the date when the
application of the plaintiff for taking the written statement off the record was
dismissed. The said application was rejected by the Court. In the present
case the written statement though filed by the defendant earlier, was
permitted to be taken on record only on a subsequent date and the replication
was filed within 12 days from the said date. Therefore, reliance placed on
the judgment in Atlanta Limited (supra) is misplaced.
15. Therefore, I do not find any merit in the submission of the defendant
that the replication filed by the plaintiff along with admission/denial of
documents not be taken on record. Accordingly, the replication is permitted
be taken on record.

1. By way of the present judgment, I shall decide the application filed on 
behalf of the plaintiff under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC). 
2. Briefly, the case set up in the plaint is that the plaintiff is engaged in

appliances, including „pressure cookers‟ and „gas stoves‟, both electric and 
non-electric, non -stick cookwa re, induction cook -tops, mixer grinder s,

is a house mark of the plaintiff. All the plaintiff‟s products are sold under its 
house mark „PRESTIGE‟. 
3. Plaintiff also has several registrations of the trademark  „PRESTIGE‟ 
in various C lasses, details of which are given in para graph 7 of the plaint. 
The earliest registration of the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ (word per se ) in 
Classes 8 and 21  dates back to 14 th December, 1949. The trademark 
„PRESTIGE‟ (word per se) was registered in favour of the plaintiff in  Class 
11 on 16th June, 1981 in respect of „installations for cooking‟ on a „proposed 
to be used basis ‟. Subsequently, the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ (word per se) 
was registered in favour of the plaintiff on 23rd September, 1999 specifically 
in respect of „gas stoves‟ on a „proposed to be used basis‟. All the aforesaid 
trademark registrations are valid and subsistent.  
4. The plaintiff has also filed its sales turnover in respect of its products 
under the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ from the financial year 2007 -08 to 2020-
21. The turnover of the plaintiff in  the year  2007-08 was around 
Rs.339,00,00,000/-, whereas the turnover in the financial year 2020-21 was 
around Rs. 2,0 33,00,00,000. The plaintiff has also provide d the advertising

6. The defendant no.1 is engaged in the business of manufacturing and 
sale of „gas stoves‟ and its component parts . It is averred in the plaint that 
the defendant no.2 and 3 are sister concerns of the defendant no.1.  
7. In the third week of A ugust 2022, the plaintiff came across the 
trademark application dated 2 nd November, 2018 filed on behalf of the 
defendant no.1 for the registration of the device mark 
  
(hereinafter referred to as 'impugned trademark') . The plaintiff opposed the 
registration of the aforesaid mark by filing opposition on 18 th August, 2022. 
The plaintiff‟s trademark „PRESTIGE‟ in Class 11 was cited as a conflicting 
mark in the examination report of the Trade Marks Registry. Thereafter, the 
plaintiff carried out an investigati on in which it was revealed that the 
defendant no.1 has been selling „gas stoves‟ in collusion with the defendants 
no.2 and 3 under the impugned trademark in bulk and on order basis only. 
8. Accordingly, the present suit was filed seeking a decree of permanent 
injunction, passing off along with other ancillary reliefs.  
9. The defence set up by the defendant no.1 in its written statement is 
that the said defendant no.1 has been using the impugned trademark since 1st 
January, 1981. The aforesaid date finds mention in the trademark 
registration application filed on behalf of the defendant no.1 on 1 st 
November 2018. Therefore, it is claimed that the defendant no.1 is a prior 
user of the impugned trademark in respect of „gas stoves‟. The plaintiff filed 
its trademark application for the word mark „PRESTIGE‟ on 16th June, 1981 
on a „proposed to be used basis ‟. The plaintiff was aware of the user of the 
trademark „PRESTIGE‟ by the defendant no.1 since 1981.

10. In order to show its prior user c ounsel for the defendant no.1 has 
placed reliance on: 
i. The certificate of registration granted in favour of the defendant no.1 
as a Small Scale Industries unit on 21 st December, 1982. The 
application was filed on 16th August, 1980.  
ii. The classification list of excisable goods dated 8 th May, 1985 granted 
in favour of the defendant no.1 wherein the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ 
has been mentioned.  
iii. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) license granted in favour of the 
defendant no.1 on 22 nd April, 1982 in respect of the brand name 
„PRESTIGE‟.  
11. Counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff makes  the following 
submissions: 
i. Even though, the defendant no.1 claims to be the user of the 
impugned trademark from 1 st January 1981, the earliest invoice filed 
by the defendant no.1 is of 29 th March, 1982. The regi stration of the 
plaintiff‟s mark „PRESTIGE‟ (word per se) under Class 11 in respect 
of „installations for cooking‟ on a “proposed to be used basis ” is of 
16th June, 1981, which is prior to the user of the impugned trademark 
in respect of „gas stoves ‟ by the defendant no.1. Therefore, the 
defence under Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter 
referred to as „the Act‟) is not available to the defendant no.1.  
ii. Without prejudice to the aforesaid , the defendant no.1 has failed to 
make out a case of „continuous user‟ as envisaged under Section 34 of 
the Act. The defendant no. 1 has placed on record only three invoices 
showing sales of goods bearing the impugned trademark, which are of

the year 1982 . Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment of a 
Division Bench of this Court in Pioneer Nuts and Bolts Pvt. Ltd.  v. 
Goodwill Enterprises, 2009 SCC OnLine Del 2851. 
iii. Counsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on the various invoices 
showing sale of „gas stoves ‟ by the plaintiff with effect from 20 th 
September, 2007 (page no.260-300 of the plaintiff‟s document).  
Attention of the Court has been drawn to the advertisements taken out 
by the plaintiff in respect of gas stoves being sold under the trademark 
„PRESTIGE‟.  
iv. In view of the tremendous goodwill and  reputation attained by the 
usage of the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ in respect of „pressure cookers‟ 
as is evidenced by the sales turnover and promotional expenses, a case 
of passing off is also made out by the plaintiff. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on the  judgment of United Brothers v. Navin Kumar, 2006 
SCC OnLine Del 185. 
12. I have heard the counsel for the parties.  
13. Though the defendant no.1 vehemently contends that it is a prior user 
of the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ and has been continuously using the said 
trademark since the year 1981, the defendant no.1 has placed on record only 
three invoices, all of the year 1982 in support of his contention.  
14. A query was put to the counsel for the defendant no.1 that if the 
defendant no.1 has been continuously using the afo resaid trademark since 
1981, why has the defendant  no.1 placed on record only three invoices. It 
was further put to the counsel for the defendant no.1  that whether any sales 
in respect of the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ had been made in the last ten years.

15. Counsel for the defendant no. 1 submits that he may be given further 
time so as to file documents to show the use of the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ 
between the year 1981 till the current date.  
16. Under Sub-Rule 7 of Order XI Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 as applicable to commercial suits under the Commercial Courts Act, 
2015, a defendant has to file a list of all documents and photocopies of all 
documents, in its power, possession, control or custody, pertaining to the 
suit, along with the written statement. Sub-Rule 10 of Order XI Rule 1 of the 
CPC further provides th at the defendant cannot be allowed to rely on 
documents, which were in the defendant‟s power, possession, control or 
custody and not disclosed along with the written statement , except with the 
leave of Court.  
17. What emerges form a reading of the aforesaid provisions is that along 
with the written statement the defendant has to file all documents in his 
power and possession and in support of his case.  Additional documents can 
be filed only with a leave of the Court and upon th e defendant giving a  
reasonable explanation for not filing the same with the written statement. 
Admittedly, no such application has been filed on behalf of the defendant 
no.1 seeking leave to file additional documents.  Therefore, no further time 
can be granted to the defendant  no.1 to place additional documents on 
record. As the defendant no.1 claims to be „ continuous user ‟ of the 
trademark „PRESTIGE‟ from 1981, it should have filed documents 
evidencing such „continuous user ‟. In the absence of any documents, the 
Court shall pre sume that there was no „continuous user ‟ by the defendant  
no.1.

18. In this regard reference may be made to  the judgment of a Division 
Bench of this Court in Pioneer Nuts (supra). In Pioneer Nuts (supra) relying 
upon the earlier judgments in Amaravathi Enterprises v. Karaikudi 
Chettinadu, 2008 (36) PTC 688 (Madras)(DB)  and in Veerumal Praveen 
Kumar v. Needle Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd. , 2001 (21) PTC 668 (Delhi), 
the Division Bench has observed that a trader  has to show that in relation to 
particular goods, there is a goodwill connecting the trader with the goods on 
account of the use of trademark. Holding that the defendant in the said case 
had failed to place evidence on record to show that it ha d actually sold its 
goods using the impugned marks other than two newspaper advertisements 
and a few trade enquiries, the Division Bench was pleased to grant interim 
injunction in favour of the plaintiff. It was further observed that mere filing 
of a trademark applic ation and giving an arbitrary date of user would not in 
itself constitute evidence of use from the said date.  
19. The aforesaid dicta is fully applicable to the facts of the present case. 
In the present case, the trademark application has been filed on behalf  of the 
defendant no.1 only on 2 nd November, 2018 claiming user from 1 st January, 
1981. Other than three invoices of the year 1982 and few statutory 
registrations in favour of the defendant no.1, no credible evidence in the 
form of invoices or advertisemen ts or other material  has been filed to show 
that the defendant no.1 has been continuously using the impugned trademark 
so as to constitute any goodwill or reputation in its favour. Accordingly, I 
am of the view that the defendant no.1 has at best shown sporadic use of the 
impugned trademark, which would not qualify it as a „continuous user‟ in 
terms of section 34 of the Act.

20. Counsel for the defendant no.1 vehemently contends that the 
trademark application filed on behalf of the plaintiff is on a „ proposed to be 
used‟ basis and the plaintiff has not filed any documents to show their user. 
To claim the defence of section 34 of the Act, defendant no.1 has to show its 
continuous user prior to (a) user of the plaintiff or (b) date of registration in 
favour of the plaintiff in respect of the said goods, whichever is earlier.  
21. In the present case, the date of registration in favour of the plaintiff in 
respect of „installations for cooking‟ is of 16 th June, 1981, which is the 
earlier date. The phrase „installation s for cooking‟ would cover within its 
scope 'gas stoves‟. Three invoices filed on behalf of the defendant no.1  are 
admittedly of a subsequent date. Defendant no.1 has also placed reliance on 
the Small Scale Industries (SSI) certificate dated 21st December, 1982, BIS 
license dated 24th April, 1982 as well as excise documents dated 8 th May, 
1985 in support of his submission that the defendant  no.1 is a prior user of 
the trademark „PRESTIGE‟. The SSI certificate in favour of the defendant 
no.1 does not mention t he trademark „PRESTIGE‟. Both the BIS license as 
well as excise documents are after the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ of the 
plaintiff was registered in Class 11. Therefore, the defendant no.1 has failed 
to establish use of the impugned trademark prior to the regis tration granted 
in favour of the plaintiff. Admittedly, no defence has been taken in the 
written statement with regard to validity of the registration granted in favour 
of the plaintiff.  
22. On the basis of the sales turnover as well as the promotional expenses 
placed on record by the plaintiff, the plaintiff has also established, at a prima 
facie stage, immense goodwill and reputation of its trademark „PRESTIGE‟, 
albeit in respect of „pressure cooker s‟. The plaintiff  has been selling its

products under the tr ademark „PRESTIGE‟ since 1955 and the earliest 
registration of the plaintiff ‟s mark is of  14th December, 1949. Further, the 
plaintiff has placed on record  various invoices from the year 2007 to show 
sales of „gas stoves‟ and advertisements of the year 2019 to show that it was 
in the business of selling „gas stoves ‟ under the trademark „PRESTIGE‟.  
Even the defendant no.1 does not dispute the position that the plaintiff ha s 
been selling „pressure cookers ‟ under the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ much 
before the defendant no.1. The only defence put forth by the defendant no.1 
is that „pressure cookers ‟ and „gas stoves ‟ are different products and 
therefore, there would be no confusion in the market.  
23. In this regard, counsel for the plaintiff has correctly placed reliance on 
the judgment of a Co -ordinate Bench of this Court in United Brothers 
(supra), which dealt with the passing off claim in respect of the same 
products that are subject matter of the present suit viz. „LPG stoves ‟ and 
„pressure cookers ‟ being sold under th e same trademark, „United‟. While 
granting injunction in favour of the plaintiff, the Co-ordinate Bench 
observed that the goods of the plaintiff as well as the defendants are both 
used as kitchen appliances and therefore , there would be confusion for the 
consumer using both the products. Further,  in view of the sales turnover as 
well as advertising expenses filed by the plaintiff,  the plaintiff was able to 
establish that its trademark ha d acquired distinctiveness and goodwill in the 
market. Accordingly, it was observed that confusion is likely to be caused in 
the mind of public and hence,  the interim injunction granted in favour of the 
plaintiff was confirmed.  
24. The aforesaid judgment is clearly applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of the present case a s the two goods in question in the said

case and case at hand  are identical. The use of the trademark „PRESTIGE‟ 
by the defendant no.1 in respect of „gas stoves‟ is likely to cause confusion 
in the market as the public at large would associate the said pro ducts of the 
defendant no.1 with the plaintiff.  
25. In view of the discussion above, a prima facie case of infringement as 
well as passing off is made out on behalf of the plaintiff. Balance of 
convenience is also in favour of plaintiff and against the defendant no.1. The 
plaintiff shall continue to suffer irreparable injury to its goodwill and 
reputation if the defendant  no.1 is permitted to manufacture and sell goods 
bearing the impugned trademark. 
26. Accordingly, the present application is allowed  and the defendant 
no.1, its directors, sister concerns, assigns in business, distributors, stockists, 
dealers and agents are injuncted  from manufacturing, selling, offering for 
sale, exporting, advertising in any manner including on the internet and 
websites, directly or indirectly dealing in gas stoves or in any kitchenware, 
cookware and/or cognate/allied/related goods under the mark  
  
or any other mark which is identical o r deceptively similar to the plaintiff‟s 
„PRESTIGE‟ trademarks.

27. Counsels for the defendants no.2 and 3 submit that they are not the 
sister concern s of the defendant no.1 and do not manufacture or s ell any 
product using the impugned trademark.

no objection if a decr ee of permanent injunction is passed against them

clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) against the defendants no.2 and 3.

plaintiffs‟ SanDisk mark is of 14 th November, 2003. The said marks of the 
plaintiffs are also registered by the plaintiff  no.1 in various fore ign 
countries.  
2.3. The p laintiff no.1 sells its memory cards in a unique and distinct

Blade‟. Pursuant thereto, the plaintiffs availed the services of an 
investigator, to ascertain the business activities of the defendant.  The

 ],  and Cruzer Blade.  The relevant portion of the 
said order is as under: 
“Keeping in view the aforesaid, this Court is of the opinion that 
a prima facie case of infringement is made out in favour of the

concert with them are restrained from manufacturing, 
marketing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly or

of plaint, which was allowed vide order dated 4 th February, 2019 passed by 
the Joint Registrar.  Order dated 16 th May, 2019 records that the defendant 
did not wish to file written statement to the amended plaint and therefore, 
the pleadings stood complete. 
6. The defendant has not been appearing in the suit since 20 th April, 
2022 and vide order dated 28th February, 2023, the defendant was proceeded 
against ex parte. 
7. Accordingly, the present application for passing a summary judgment 
has been filed. 
8. Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that this is a fit case where a 
Summary Judgment  in terms of Order XIII -A of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, as applicable to commercial disputes of a specified value, read 
with Rule 27 of the Delhi High Court Intellectual Property Rights Division 
Rules, 2022 (in short, „IPD Rules‟), deserves to be passed in favour of the 
plaintiffs and against the defendant. 
ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS  
9. I have heard the counsel for the plaintiffs and p erused the record of 
the case.

therewith, the plaintiffs have been able to prove that they are the registered 
proprietors of the SanDisk trademarks  and the said registrations are valid 
and subsisting. The plaintiffs have also been able to show their goodwill and 
reputation in respect of the SanDisk trademarks.  Plaintiffs have established 
statutory as well as common law  rights on account of long usage of the 
SanDisk trademarks. 
11. A comparison of the original products of the plaintiffs and the 
counterfeit products of the defendant has been made in paragraph 33 of the 
plaint. From the comparison it is clear that the defendant has made use of 
identical trademarks and packaging in relation to counterfeit goods. The 
report of the Local Commissioner also shows that the defendant is indulging 
in marketing and sales of counterfeit pro ducts, which bear the identical 
marks as that of the plaintiffs. 
12. The marketing and selling of counterfeit products  by the defendant 
not only amount to infringing the registered SanDisk trademarks and 
copyrights of the plaintiffs but also to passing off the goods of the defendant 
as that of the plaintiffs. The defendant has taken unfair advantage of the 
reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs‟ mark s and has also deceived 
unwary consumers of its association with the plaintiffs. Such acts of the 
defendant would also lead to dilution of the plaintiffs‟ marks. 
13. The defendant in its written statement to the original plaint has made 
bare averments without placing on record any substantial documentary 
evidence. Moreover, since the defendant has failed to enter appearance after 
20th April, 2022, despite having suffered an ad interim injunction order, it is 
evident that the defendant has nothing substantial to urge.  
14. I am of the opinion that no purpose would be served by directing the

plaintiffs to lead ex parte evidence by filing an affidavit of examination in 
chief. Therefore, in my opinion, this is a fit case where a Summary 
Judgment in terms of Order XIII-A of the CPC, as applicable to commercial 
disputes of a specified value, read with Rule 27 of the IPD Rules, de serves 
to be passed in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendant.  Reference 
in this regard may be made to the judgment in Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd. 
v. Kunwer Sachdev, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 10764,  wherein this Court  has 
observed as under: 
“90. To reiterate, the intent behind incorporating the summary 
judgment procedure in the Commercial Court Act, 2015 is to 
ensure disposal of commercial disputes in a time -bound 
manner. In fact, the applicability of Order XIIIA, CPC to 
commercial disputes, demonstrate s that the trial is no longer 
the default procedure/norm. 
 
91. Rule 3 of Order XIIIA, CPC, as applicable to commercial 
disputes, empowers the Court to grant a summary judgement 
against the defendant where the Court considers that the 
defendant has no real prospects of successfully defending the 
claim and there is no other compelling reason why the claim 
should not be disposed of before recording of oral evidence. 
The expression “real” directs the Court to examine whether 
there is a “realistic” as opposed to  “fanciful” prospects of 
success. This Court is of the view that the expression “no 
genuine issue requiring a trial” in Ontario Rules of Civil 
Procedure and “no other compelling reason…..for trial” in 
Commercial Courts Act can be read  mutatis mutandis. 
Consequently, Order XIIIA, CPC would be attracted if the 
Court, while hearing such an application, can make the 
necessary finding of fact, apply the law to the facts and the 
same is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive 
means of achieving a fair and just result. 
 
92. Accordingly, unlike ordinary suits, Courts need not hold

trial in commercial suits, even if there are disputed questions of 
fact as held by the Canadian Supreme Court in  Robert 
Hryniak (supra), in the event, the Court comes to the conclusion 
that the defendant lacks a real prospect of successfully 
defending the claim.” 
 
15. The aforesaid principles are fully applicable in the facts and 
circumstances of the present case and therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled to 
a summary judgment. 
16. In view of the above, the present application is allowed.  
RELIEF 
17. The various registrations and the long usage of the SanDisk 
trademarks by the plaintiffs, as also the goodwill vesting in the SanDisk 
trademarks, entitles the plaintiffs for grant of permanent injunction and 
decree in terms of the plaint. 
18. Accordingly, the present suit is decreed against the defendant in terms 
of the relief of permanent injunction as sought in prayer clauses 41 (a) and 
(b).  
19. Insofar as delivery up for the purpose of destruction, as sought in 
prayer clause 41(c) is concerned, the goods seized by the Local 
Commissioner, which are lying in supardari with the defendant, the details 
of which are given in paragraph 6 of the report dated 20 th July, 2018 are 
directed to be handed to the representatives of the plaintiffs forthwith for the 
purpose of destruction, in compliance with extant rules/regulations. 
20. Since the defendant is not appearing any longer and has not rendered 
any accounts of profits, the said relief as sought in prayer clause  41(d) 
cannot be granted.

21. The Local Commissioner found a total number of 253 infringing and 
counterfeit goods at the premises of the defendant, which were inventorized 
by him and seized and handed over on supardari to the defendant. Further, 
the sale invoices filed by the defendant which go as far back as September, 
2016 reflect total sales of more than Rs.29,00,000. 
22. I am convinced that this is not a case of innocent adoption and 
therefore, the plaintiff s are entitled to damages.  Taking a reasonable 
assessment of the volume of seizure made, nature of counterfeiting indulged 
into by the defendant, in the opinion of the Court, the plaintiffs are entitled 
to damages Rs,5,00,000.  
23. Plaintiffs have also incurred costs for executing the commission and 
deposited court fees. Thus, in view of the judgment of the Supr eme Court in 
Uflex v. Government of Tamil Nadu, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 738  as well as 
in terms of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and the Delhi High Court 
(Original Side) Rules, 2018 read with Delhi High Court Intellectual Property 
Division Rules, 2022, the plaintiffs are entitled to actual costs recoverable 
from the defendant. Plaintiffs shall file their bill of costs in terms of Rule 5 
of Chapter XXIII of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 on or  
before 31st March, 2023. As and when the same is filed, the matter will be 
listed before the Taxing Officer for computation of the costs.

25. All pending applications are disposed of in the above terms.

time to file written submissions.  Both the sides have filed their  respective 
brief notes of submissions. 
CASE SET UP IN THE PLAINT 
3. The case set up in the plaint is as under: 
3.1 Plaintiff company was inco rporated on 25 th March, 1996 as a private 
limited company and in the year 2006, the plaintiff company was 
converted into a public limited company.   
3.2 Plaintiff company is engaged in the business of manufacturing, 
distributing and selling of high-quality pipes, parts and fittings for use 
in plumbing, sewage , drainage, fire protection  and the like . The 
plaintiff company has manufacturing facilities at six locations in India 
and has received various awards and accolades in respect of its 
various products. 
3.3 In th e year 2004, the plaintiff company became the first entity to 
launch Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC) piping systems in 
India.  
3.4 The plaintiff has filed and obtained various registrations in respect of 
the mark ‘ CPVC PRO ’ and ‘CPVC PRO ’ formative trademarks, 
which are detailed in paragraph 15 of the plaint. 
3.5 Some of the registrations of the plaintiff have a disclaimer that no 
exclusive rights have been granted in respect of the words ‘CPVC 
PRO’ and ‘CPVC CHEM PRO’.  However, the subsequent 
registrations do not have this condition.   Some of the applications

filed on behalf of the plaintiff in respect of ‘CPVC PRO’ and ‘CPVC 
PRO’ formative marks have been objected to. 
3.6 Plaintiff has engaged various celebrities and superstars from time to 
time to advertise their products under the aforesaid trademarks. 
3.7 The statement in respect of domestic sales and exports of the plaintiff 
have been provided in para graph 20 of the plaint.  In the year 2021 –
2022, the sales of the plaintiff  in respect of the trademarks ‘CPVC 
PRO’ was around Rs.954 crores. 
3.8 On account of its superior quality , continuous and extensive use, and 
large scale publicity , the plaintiff’s trade mark ‘CPVC PRO’ has 
acquired immense reputation and goodwill in the market.  
Accordingly, the plaintiff claims bot h statutory as well as common 
law rights in the trademark ‘CPVC PRO’. 
3.9 Defendant has also filed various trademark application s in respect of 
similar products which are pending as on date .  The  grievance of the 
plaintiff is with regard to the impugned mark ‘CPVC FLOWPRO’, 
wherein ‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ are being used together and the same is 
similar to the trademark of the plaintiff, ‘CPVC PRO’. 
3.10 The trademark application  of the defendant  was filed in January , 
2021, on a „proposed to be used basis‟, whereas the plaintiff has been 
using the ‘CPVC PRO’ marks since 2016.  In this  regard, invoices 
have been placed on record by the plaintiff.   
3.11 The adoption of the trademark ‘CPVC FLOWPRO’ by the defendant 
is dishonest and an attempt to ride on the goodwill and reputatio n of 
the plaintiff.

3.12 A cease and desist notice dated 17 th December, 2021 was issued by 
the plaintiff to the defendant.  The aforesaid notice was replied to by 
the defendant. 
3.13 Accordingly, the present suit was filed seeking a decree of permanent 
injunction along with other ancillary reliefs. 
CASE SET UP IN THE WRITTEN STATEMENT  
4. The case set out in the written statement is as under: 
4.1 The plaintiff does not have any grievance with the use of the word 
‘CPVC’ by the defendant as it is an abbreviation of the material of the 
plastic.  The plaintiff objects to the use of the word ‘PRO’, which 
cannot be monopolized by the plaintiff.  Reliance is placed on the 
various dictionary meanings of the word ‘PRO’, which show that the 
word ‘PRO’ is a generic, descriptive and laud atory word.  The word 
‘PRO’ is used by several well -known companies  in relation to 
different products as part of their marks, details of which are given in 
paragraph 14 of the written statement. 
4.2 In several of the registrations granted in favour of the pla intiff, a 
condition has been imposed on the plaintiff that the plaintiff shall not 
have exclusive right over the marks/terms ‘CPVC PRO’, ‘CPVC 
CHEM PRO’ and ‘CHEM PRO’.  Further, several of the plaintiff’s 
marks were refused registration under Section 9 of  the Trade Marks 
Act, 1999.  Therefore, the other registrations granted to the plaintiff in 
respect of ‘CPVC PRO’ formative marks are bad in law and the 
plaintiff cannot rely upon them.

4.3 The trademark registrations in respect of word marks ‘CPVC PRO’ 
have to be treated as suspended since it was obtained during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Reliance in this regard is placed on the 
judgment dated 21st March, 2022 passed by this Court in WP(C)-IPD 
No.4/2022 titled Dr. Reddy Laboratories Limited v. Controller 
General of Patents Designs and Trademarks. 
4.4  The plaintiff has always used the words ‘CPVC PRO’ in conjunction 
with its house mark ‘ASTRAL’ and has never used the same 
independently. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot claim any 
distinctiveness in respect of the mark ‘CPVC PRO’.  
4.5 The defendant has been selling its products under the trademark 
 since the year 1975.  Details of turnover of the 
defendant are given on page 44, paragraph 11 of the written 
statement.  In the year 2021, the defendant had a revenue of around 
Rs.3,500 crores. 
4.6 Defendant has been selling and exporting products under the mark 
 since November, 2021. 
4.7 The mark/expression ‘ASHIRVAD BY ALIAXIS CPVC 
FLOWPRO’ is dissimilar to the mark/expression used by the plaintiff 
and therefore, there cannot be any ca use for confusion.  Both the 
plaintiff and the defendant use their house marks ‘ASTRAL’ and 
‘ASHIRVAD’ respectively in conjunction with the words ‘CPVC’, 
‘PRO’ and/or ‘CPVC PRO’.

SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF  OF THE PLAINTIFF  
5. Supplementing the  averments made in t he plaint , counsel for the 
plaintiff made the following submissions: 
5.1 In view of the fact that the plaintiff has obtained subsequent 
registrations without any disclaimer, the conditions imposed while 
granting earlier registrations are not relevant and the present suit for 
infringement and passing off is maintainable. 
5.2 The adoption of the mark ‘CPVC FLOWPRO ’ by the defendant  is 
dishonest as the words ‘CPVC FLOWPRO’ are the most prominent 
words used on their pipes and fittings. The defendant is already selling 
CPVC pipes under the trademark ‘ASHIRVAD FLOW GUARD’ in 
terms of the license agreement entered into by the plaintiff with 
Lubrizol. 
5.3 A party can be given proprietary rights e ven in respect of  laudatory 
and dictionary words . In view of the fact that the defe ndant has also 
applied for registration in respect of the words ‘CPVC PRO ’, the 
defendant cannot claim that the said mark is generic. 
5.4 No one in the market is using the mark ‘CPVC PRO ’ or the word 
‘PRO’ in respect of pipes and fittings.   
SUBMISSIONS ON BEH ALF OF THE DEFENDANT  
6. In support of the averments  made in the written statement, s enior  
counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant has  made the following 
submissions: 
6.1 Even though in respect of four of the plaintiff’s registrations, there is a 
disclaimer in respect of the word ‘CPVC PRO’, the plaintiff has

deliberately filed applications in various Classes in respect of the 
trademark ‘CPVC PRO’ so that some of the registrations are granted 
without any disclaimers. 
6.2 Descriptive and generic marks such as ‘CPVC’ and/or ‘PRO’ cannot 
be monopolized by a party on the ground that they are the first user 
thereof. 
6.3 Without prejudice to the contention of the defendant that the word 
‘PRO’ is laudatory and cannot be monopolized, the defendant  is not 
using the word ‘PRO’ on a stand-alone basis.  The defendant  is using 
the term ‘FLOWPRO’ in conjunction with ‘CPVC’. 
6.4 The pipes and fixtures in the market are known by the respective 
brands, which in the present case is ‘ASTRAL’ in respect of the 
plaintiff and ‘ASHIRVAD’ in res pect of the defendant.  Both the 
aforesaid brands are distinctive and appear prominently on the 
products of the parties. There cannot be any question of passing off as 
products of both plaintiff and defendant are sold with their house 
marks. 
6.5 Evidence of su bsequent use of  the mark post  registration cannot be 
looked into in an infringement action. 
6.6 Whether or not the marks ‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ have acquired 
distinctiveness is a matter of trial. 
7. I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the record.  
ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS  
8. At the outset, reference may be made to the competing marks of the 
parties, which are reproduced hereinbelow:

PLAINTIFF ’S MARKS DEFENDANT ’S MARK 
 
 
 
 
9. A perusal of the above would show that the defendant is using the 
words ‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ along with its house mark ‘ASHIRVAD’ / 
‘ASHIRVAD BY ALIAXIS’ even though the house mark is written in a 
slightly smaller font . In the first instance, the plaintiff is using the words 
‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ along with its house mark ‘ASTRAL’. In the seco nd 
instance, the plaintiff is using ‘CPVC PRO’ without its house mark 
‘ASTRAL’. Where the term ‘ASTRAL’ is used by the plaintiff in 
conjunction with ‘CPVC PRO’, the usage of the distinctive house marks of 
the parties negate any possibility of deception or confusion in the marks. 
Further, in both the aforesaid usages of the plaintiff, the word ‘CPVC’ , in 
respect of which the plaintiff does not claim exclusivity, is written in a much 
larger font as compared to the other elements of the mark. In fact, the word  
‘PRO’, for which the plaintiff seeks exclusivity , has been written in a 
smaller font in the plaintiff’s product, whereas in the defendant’s product, it 
is in the same font size as the word ‘CPVC’. Further, the word ‘PRO’ is not 
being used by itself but as  a component of the term ‘FLOWPRO’  by the

defendant. Even the font and style of writing of ‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ in the 
competing marks are distinguishable. Therefore, in my prima facie view it 
cannot be said that there is a possibility of confusion or deceptio n being 
caused among the customers of the two products.  
10. At this stage, r eference may be made  to the various trademark 
registrations granted to the plaintiff as set out in paragraph 15 of the plaint.

11. A perusal of the table above would show that the registrations at serial 
no.1 to 10 are of various composite marks, which include the house mark of 
the plaintiff, ‘ASTRAL’.  The registrations at serial no.11 to 15 are 
subsequent registrations in respect of device marks with the words  ‘CPVC 
MULTI PRO’, ‘CPVC CHEM PRO’, ‘CPVC PRO’ and ‘CPVC FIRE PRO’ 
written in a stylized manner.  The registrations at serial no.1 to 3  and 12  
above have a condition that no exclusive rights have been given to the 
plaintiff over the terms ‘ CPVC PRO ’, ‘CPVC CHEM PRO ’ and ‘CHEM 
PRO’. It is also be noted that the applications  at serial no. 11 to 15 in the 
table above have been filed on a „proposed to be used basis‟ , except serial 
no. 14 , which has been filed with the claim of use of around one mo nth.  
Furthermore, a perusal of the registration granted in favour of the plaintiff at 
serial no. 1 4 would also show that the registration ha s been granted in 
respect of  the stylized manner of writing  and not in respect of the words 
‘CPVC PRO’ either in conjunction with each other or individually.  
12. It is  also relevant to note here that other applications filed by the 
plaintiff for the mark ‘CPVC PRO’ and ‘CPVC PRO’ formative marks, all 
dated 6 th September, 2016 , have been objected to by the Registry on the 
ground that they lack distinctiveness.  Yet, the applications at serial no.11 to

15, in respect of similar trademarks, were accepted by the Registry.  Further, 
when conditions with regard to use of the term ‘CPVC PRO’ have been 
imposed on the earlier regis trations of the plaintiff given at serial no.1 to 3  
and 12 above, there is no explanation as to why similar conditions were not 
imposed by the Registry in respect of the trademark applications  given at 
serial no.11, 13, 14 and  15 above. It appears that the plaintiff was randomly 
filing registrations for marks with minor variations in several Classes , 
hoping that some of the registrations would be granted without any 
conditions. To illustrate, the plaintiff has been granted registration in respect 
of the mark 
  in Class 19 without any disclaimer/condition on 
the registration , whereas  registration of the identical mark under TM 
Application No.3355649 has been refused by the Registry in Class 17.  This 
raises a serious doubt with regard to the validity of the re gistrations granted 
in favour of the plaintiff at serial no.11 to 15 in the table above. Therefore, 
at this interlocutory stage, the plaintiff cannot claim monopoly over the 
words ‘CPVC’ or ‘PRO’ either individually or in conjunction with each 
other/other words and these registrations cannot be relied upon the plaintiff 
in the present suit for infringement. 
13. The registrations at serial no.16 and 17 were in respect of ‘CPVC 
PRO’ word marks per se. The same were granted in 2020, during the 
COVID-19 period, in the absence of any oppositions. In this regard , 
reference may be made to the judgment in Dr. Reddy Laboratories Limited 
(supra), wherein a Coordinate Bench of this Court has made the following 
observations:

stand of the CGPDTM before the Delhi High Court in W.P.(C) 
3059/2020, the CGPDTM has a duty to extend the limitation for 
filing oppositions to trademark applications… 
 
(v) Insofar as trademark registration certificates which may 
have been issued during the pandemic period, the 
registration certificates shall be dealt with in the following 
manner:  
 
(a) In respect of the trademark applications in which no 
oppositions have been alread y filed or are received till 
30th May, 2022, the said registration certificates shall 
remain valid and the said applicants shall enjoy their 
statutory rights in accordance with law.  
 
(b) In respect of those trademark applications where 
oppositions have al ready been filed or are filed by 30th 
May, 2022, the registration certificates shall either not 
be issued or if already issued, the same shall stand 
suspended till the oppositions are decided by the office 
of the CGPDTM.” 
14. In light of the aforesaid  judgment, since the defendant had filed 
oppositions before 30th May, 2022, the registrations granted in favour of the 
plaintiff and provided at serial no.16 and 17 in the table above would stand 
suspended until the oppositions are decided. Therefore, no reliance c an be 
placed on the registrations of the word mark ‘CPVC PRO’.  
15. Counsel for the plaintiff has further submitted that the plaintiff has no 
objection to the defendant using the word ‘CPVC’ as it is an abbreviation for 
a material of the plastic. However, an o bjection is raised with regard to the 
use of the word ‘PRO’ in conjunction with the word ‘CPVC’  as the plaintiff 
claims that the word ‘CPVC FLOWPRO ’ is deceptively similar to the mark 
used by the plaintiff , ‘CPVC PRO’. It is a settled position of law that

generic, laudatory and descriptive marks cannot be monopolized by anyone  
unless a case is made out in respect of the mark acquiring distinctive 
character or of its well-known status. The fact that conditions were imposed  
on the plaintiff by the Registry, against the use of generic terms like ‘CPVC 
PRO’ and ‘CPVC CHEM PRO’ , is clearly indicative of the fact that the 
plaintiff cannot monopolize the term s ‘CPVC’ or ‘PRO’, individually or in 
conjunction with each other. 
16. To show that the word ‘PRO’ is generic and laudatory, the counsel for 
the defendant has submitted dictionary meanings of the said word, which are 
as under: 
“Cambridge Dictionary: The word „PRO‟ means: 
 
(a) „ a professional or somebody who is better than others  at 
doing something; 
 
(b) „a person who receives money for playing a sport‟; 
 
Oxford Dictionary: The word PRO means: 
 
„a person who works as a professional, especially in a sport‟.” 
 
17. In support of their submission that the word ‘PRO’ is commonly used 
in the trade, the defendant has also placed  material on record to show that 
various companies are selling pipes and other products in the construction 
industry using the word ‘PRO’. Counsel for the plaintiff has disputed this 
submission and stated that no other pipes with the word mark ‘PRO’ are 
available in the market. Be that as it may, this aspect can only be established 
in the trial and at a prima facie  stage, the Court would have to take 
cognizance of the material placed on record by the defendant.

18. Counsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on my judgment in  
Soothe Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. v. Dabur India Limited , 2022 SCC OnLine 
Del  645 . In the said case , the plaintiff sought an interim injunction against 
the defendant on the ground that the trademark of the defendant ‘SUPER 
PANTS’ was deceptive ly similar to the trademark of the plaintiff ‘SUPER 
CUTES’ and ‘SUPER CUTESTERS’. Relying upon the judgment of a 
Division Bench of this Court in Marico Limited  v. Agro Tech Food 
Limited, 2010 (44) PTC 736 (Del) DB, the application for interim injunction 
was dismissed. It was held, inter alia, that since the word ‘SUPER’ is being 
used in a laudatory manner, it is  devoid of any distinctive character and 
incapable of distinguishing the goods of the plaintiff from that of others, and 
therefore, even if the plai ntiff had obtained registration in respect of the 
mark ‘SUPER’, it would not give the plaintiff exclusive right to use  the 
mark ‘SUPER’.  It was further noted that the fact that the house mark is 
written in a slightly smaller font would not make a material difference. One 
of the other grounds for denying injunction was that the defendant in the 
said case was using the mark ‘SUPER  PANTS’ along with its house mark 
‘Dabur’. The relevant observations of the said judgment are set out below: 
“8. A comparison of the packaging of the defendant and the 
plaintiff above shows that other than the word “SUPER” 
occurring in both the aforesaid packaging, there is no other 
similarity. The packaging of the defendant includes the trade 
mark of the defendant, “Dabur” which is p rominently 
displayed. Merely because the word “Dabur” is written in a 
slightly smaller font as compared to “SUPER PANTS”, in my 
opinion, would not make any difference. The fact of the matter 
is that the word “Dabur” is prominently displayed on the 
packaging along with the word “baby”. The colour scheme of 
the packaging is also totally different. The colour scheme of the

plaintiff is yellow and orange/blue and yellow, and the 
defendant is primarily green. From the description of the 
packaging of the defendant's product, it is more than clear that 
there is enough added material therein to distinguish the 
defendant's product from that of the plaintiff. Therefore, it 
cannot be said that there is a possibility of confusion or 
deception being caused among the cust omers of the two 
products. Hence, I am not convinced that the defendant is 
passing off their goods as those of the plaintiff. 
 
9. The next issue that comes up for consideration is 
whether word “SUPER” is a descriptive or a laudatory word 
and whether it can  attain distinctiveness in respect of the 
goods of the plaintiff. As per the  Oxford's Learners 
Dictionary, the word “SUPER” means “extremely good”, and 
as per the  Cambridge Dictionary  also, the word “SUPER” 
means “excellent or extremely good”. Clearly, as per its 
dictionary meaning, the word “super; is a laudatory word of 
the English Language. 
 
XXX    XXX     XXX 
 
13. In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the mark 
“SUPER” is devoid of any distinctive character and not 
capable of distinguishing the goods of the plaintiff. Therefore, 
even if the plaintiff has obtained registration in respect of the 
marks “SUPER CUTESTERS”, “SUPER CUTES” and 
“SUPER CUTEZ”, it would not give him exclusive right over 
the use of the word “SUPER”.” 
 
19. The appeal filed agains t the aforesaid judgment was dismissed by the 
judgment of a Division Bench of this Court, reported as Soothe Healthcare 
Private Limited v. Dabur India Limited, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2006. The 
relevant observations of the Division Bench are set out below:

“37.  The judgments relied upon are not applicable to the facts 
of the present case. There is no quarrel to the proposition that 
even an ordinary word or a descriptive word, if acquires a 
secondary meaning and has acquired a distinctive character, can 
be prot ected by way of an injunction when identified with a 
particular product or being from a particular source. As 
discussed above, DABUR's mark, i.e., “DABUR BABY SUPER 
PANTS” when taken as a whole cannot be termed as deceptively 
similar to SOOTHE's registered marks referred in „paragraph 2‟ 
above. As far as the use of the word “SUPER” by DABUR in its 
mark, the same,  prima facie  seems to be laudatory and 
descriptive of the product being offered by DABUR. 
Indisputably, the term “SUPER” is widely used in respect of 
various products not only of similar nature but also of different 
class and categories. SOOTHE cannot, therefore,  prima 
facie claim that the use of the word “SUPER” by DABUR in its 
mark is deceptively similar to SOOTHE's registered trademark 
for the rea son that the word “SUPER” also appears in 
SOOTHE's marks referred in „paragraph 2‟ above. SOOTHE 
also cannot  prima facie  claim that the word “SUPER” 
appearing in its registered mark has acquired a secondary 
meaning or a distinctive character when used in a  particular 
product of SOOTHE, i.e., diapers.” 
 
20. The present case is covered on all fours by the aforesaid judgments. 
The word ‘PRO’, of which exclusive use was sought by the plaintiff, is 
similar to the word ‘SUPER’ as both are laudatory words. Prima facie, the 
word ‘PRO’, either by itself or in conjunction with the word ‘CPVC’, 
appears to be non -distinctive and laudatory in terms of Section 9 of the 
Trade Marks Act, 1999 . Even if the plaintiff has obtained registrations in 
respect of ‘CPVC PRO’ and ‘CPVC P RO’ formative marks,  the plaintiff 
cannot have exclusive rights to use the word ‘PRO’ . Hence, at this 
interlocutory stage, the plaintiff has failed to make out a case of 
infringement.

21. Plaintiff has also claimed that the mark ‘CPVC PRO’ has become 
distinctive of its goods on account of its usage. Admittedly, the plaintiff has 
used the mark ‘CPVC PRO’ and other formative marks using the words 
‘CPVC’ and PRO’ only with effect from 2016. Nothing has been filed on 
behalf of the plaintiff to show that the plainti ff has advertised or promoted 
the mark ‘CPVC PRO’ on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, at an interlocutory 
stage, the plaintiff cannot claim acquired distinctiveness or goodwill in the 
term ‘CPVC PRO’, which can only be established during the trial.  Even 
otherwise, as observed above, a comparison of the competing marks of the 
plaintiff and the defendant reveals that there is no likelihood of confusion in 
the market. Hence, I am of the prima facie view that the defendant is not 
passing off its goods as those of the plaintiff. 
22. Counsel for the plaintiff has vehemently argued that the products in 
question, pipes, are used by plumbers, who identify the product with the 
term ‘CPVC PRO’ and not the house marks.  I do not find merit in this 
submission of the plaintiff.  I see no reason as to why persons in the trade, 
including plumbers, would not identify with a product through the house 
mark which finds mention on the product. Nor has the plaintiff filed any 
material to substantiate such a claim. 
23. Counsel for the plainti ff has placed strong reliance on the recent 
judgment of the Division Bench in PEPS Industries Private Limited v. 
Kurlon Limited, 2022 SCC OnLine  Del 3275 to contend that (i) when the 
defendant has sought for registration of the same mark as that of the plaintiff 
(‘NO TURN’ in the said case ), such a defendant is estopped from raising a 
question on the validity of the said mark on the ground of it being 
descriptive in nature; and, (ii) registration granted in favour of the plaintiff is

prima facie evidence of its validity and cannot be ignored unless a question 
on the validity of the registration is raised. 
24. In the present case, the defendant has sought registration of the marks 
bearing the word ‘CPVC’ not on a stand-alone basis but along with its house 
mark ‘ ASHIRVAD’. Therefore, it cannot be said that the defendant is 
estopped from raising the issue of non -distinctiveness of the term ‘CPVC 
PRO’ or its individual components.  Further, in the present case, the 
defendant has raised objections with regard to vali dity of the registration s 
granted in favour of the plaintiff.  Therefore, the judgment in PEPS 
Industries (supra) is clearly distinguishable and would not advance the case 
of the plaintiff. 
25. In light of the discussion above, I am of the view that the plaintiff has 
failed to make out a prima facie case for grant of interim injunction. 
26. Accordingly, I.A.7334/2022 filed on behalf of the plaintiff under 
Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC is dismissed.

Rights (Imported Goods) Enforcement Rules, 2007 (hereinafter referred to 
as „IPR Enforcement Rules‟), on accou nt of  the import of goods  by the 
defendant. The applicant had passed a seizure memo dated 2nd May, 2018 in 
respect of 9,644pieces of the goods imported by the defendant under Section 
110(1) of the Customs Act, 1962. It is also the case of the applicant that 
goods which have been imported into India are in violation of paragraph 2.3 
of the Foreign Trade Policy, 2015 -20 and are therefore , liable for 
confiscation under Section 111(d) of the Customs Act, 1962. 
3. Both the plaintiff and the defendant s have oppos ed the present 
application. Plaintiffs have filed reply in opposition to the aforesaid 
application, wherein it stated that the present suit has been filed on the basis 
of infringement of the plaintiffs ‟ trademarks by the defendant and therefore, 
the applic ant is neither a necessary and nor a proper party for the 
adjudication of the present suit. The applicant, vide its letter dated 24th April, 
2018, asked the plaintiff of its willingness to join the proceedings , failing 
which the applicant would release the seized goods. Rule 11 of the Customs 
Rules states that if the infringing goods have been confiscated and no legal 
proceedings are pending in relation to such goods, the applicant may 
proceed to destroy the goods after obtaining „No-Objection Certificate‟ from 
the intellectual property right holder.  Since the plaintiff has chosen to file  
the present suit for injunction, the applicant  cannot proceed under the IPR 
Enforcement Rules during the pendency of th e present suit. Therefore, the 
applicant is neither a necessary party nor a proper party.

has observed that the ge neral rule with regard to impleadment of parties is 
that the plaintiff in a suit, being dominus litis , may choose the persons 
against whom he wishes to litigate and cannot be compelled to sue a person 
against whom he does not seek any relief. 
6. In Kasturi v. Iyyamperumal, (2005) 6 SCC 733 , the Supreme Court 
laid down the tests to determine as to who is a necessary party and proper 
party in a suit. The relevant portions are set out below: 
“7*.  In our view, a bare reading of this provision, namely, 
second part  of Order 1 Rule 10 sub -rule (2) CPC would 
clearly show that the necessary parties in a suit for specific 
performance of a contract for sale are the parties to the 
contract or if they are dead, their legal representatives as also 
a person who had purchased  the contracted property from the 
vendor. In equity as well as in law, the contract constitutes 
rights and also regulates the liabilities of the parties. A 
purchaser is a necessary party as he would be affected if he 
had purchased with or without notice of  the contract, but a 
person who claims adversely to the claim of a vendor is, 
however, not a necessary party. From the above, it is now 
clear that two tests are to be satisfied for determining the 
question who is a necessary party. Tests are — (1) there must 
be a right to some relief against such party in respect of the 
controversies involved in the proceedings; (2) no effective 
decree can be passed in the absence of such party. 
… 
11. As noted hereinearlier , two tests are required to be 
satisfied to determine the question who is a necessary party, 
let us now consider who is a proper party in a suit for specific 
performance of a contract for sale. For deciding the question 
who is a proper party in a suit for specific performance the 
guiding principle is that the presence of such a party is 
necessary to adjudicate the controversies involved in the suit 
for specific performance of the contract for sale. Thus, the 
question is to be decided keeping in mind the sco pe of the 
suit. …”

7. In Vidur Impex & Traders (P) Ltd. v. Tosh Apartments (P) Ltd. , 
(2012) 8 SCC 384 , the Supreme Court has succinctly laid down the 
principles to be followed while deciding an application filed under Order 1 
Rule 10(2) of the CPC. Paragraph 36 in this regard is set out below : 
“36. Though there is apparent conflict in the observations 
made in some of the aforementioned judgments, the broad 
principles which should govern disposal of an application for 
impleadment are : 
 
1. The court can, at any stage of the proceedings, either 
on an application made by the parties or otherwise, 
direct impleadment of any person as party, who ought 
to have been joined as plaintiff or defendant or whose 
presence before the court is necessary for effective and 
complete adjudication of the issues involved in the suit. 
 
2. A necessary party is the person who ought to be 
joined as party to the suit and in whose absence an 
effective decree cannot be passed by the court. 
 
3. A proper party is a person whose  presence would 
enable the court to completely, effectively and 
properly adjudicate upon all matters and issues, 
though he may not be a person in favour of or against 
whom a decree is to be made. 
 
4. 4. If a person is not found to be a proper or necessary 
party, the court does not have the jurisdiction to order 
his impleadment against the wishes of the plaintiff.” 
 
8. At this stage, a  reference may be made to the prayers made in the 
plaint, which are set out below: 
“A. A decree of permanent  injunction restraining the 
defendants, their partners, representatives and/or others 
acting for and on their behalf for  importing, selling, offering 
for sale, advertising or otherwise dealing in infringing goods

bearing the plaintiffs’  registered trademar ks WESTERN 
DIGITAL,  and/or WD under nos.1345682, 1349235 and 
1325732 in Class 9. 
 
B. An order of delivery up of all the infringing goods 
bearing the plaintiffs’ trademarks WESTERN DIGITAL,  
and/or WD including packaging(s), cartons, labels, stickers, 
and/or publicity material bearing the impugned trademarks for 
the purposes of destruction/erasure. 
 
C. An order for damages of Rs.1,00,01,000. 
 
9. As can be seen from the above, no relief has been sought against the 
applicant. The entire case of the plaintiff is based on the infringement of the 
trademarks of the plaintiffs by the defendant.  Therefore, it can not be said 
that an effective decree cannot be passed in the present suit in the absence of 
the applicant. It is not even the case of the applica nt that the applicant is a 
necessary party, as the present application seeks impleadment  only on the 
basis of the applicant being a proper party. 
10. In terms of the legal position discussed above, for a person to be  a 
proper party to a suit , it is to be seen whether the presence of such person 
would enable the Court to completely, effectively and properly adjudicate 
upon the issue in the case. 
11. At this stage, a reference may be made to  Rule 11 of the IPR 
Enforcement Rules, the relevant portion is set out below: 
“11. Disposal of  infringing goods. –  
 
(1) Where upon determination by the Deputy Commissioner 
of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs, as the case 
may be, it is found that the goods detained or seized have 
infringed intellectual property rights, and have been

confiscated under Section 111( d) of the Customs Act, 1962 
and no legal proceedings are pending in relation to such 
determination, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or 
Assistant Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, shall 
destroy the goods under official supervision or dispose t hem 
outside the normal channels of commerce after obtaining “no 
objection” or concurrence of the right holder or his authorized 
representative.    
…” 
 
12. In terms of the aforesaid Rule, the applicant has the jurisdiction to 
determine if the seized goods  are infringing the Intellectual Property Rights 
of the plaintiffs, only in the event of no legal proceedings being pending in 
relation to such determination . However, t he present suit is such a legal 
proceeding in which a  determination is to  be made whether th e goods 
imported by the defendant are infringing or not. Therefore, in terms of Rul e 
11 of IPR Enforcement Rules, the applicant cannot go into the question of 
infringement till the final adjudication of the present suit. 
13. In the event, this Court comes to a  finding that the defendant has not 
infringed the trademarks of the plaintiff s, the said determination shall be 
binding on the applicant and there cannot be any question of destruction of 
the infringing goods.  On the other hand, if a final determination is made by 
this Court that the goods have infringed the trademark s of the plaintiff s, 
appropriate orders shall be passed with regard to the aforesaid goods. 
14. In view of the discussion above, the applicant is neither a necessary 
party nor a proper party for the adjudication of the suit. There is no merit in 
the present application and the same is dismissed. 
15. Needless to state t his is without prejudice to any other statutory 
rights/remedy of the applicant.

2. On 29 th November, 2022, the statement of counsel for the plaintiff 
was recorded that he does not wish to file reply and the application may be 
heard on the basis of oral submissions.   
3. The brief facts relevant for deciding the present application are set out 
below: 
3.1 The present suit has been filed alleging infringement of trade marks, 
copyright and passing off of the trademark/label “DEHLVI”.   
3.2 The plaintiff claims to be the proprietor of the mark “DEHLVI”. 
3.3 The defendant has filed written statement opposin g the reliefs sought 
in the plaint, inter alia, pleading that the various registrations of the 
mark/label “DEHLVI” in favour of the plaintiff are invalid and liable 
to be cancelled. It has further been pleaded in the written statement 
that the alleged Assi gnment Deed dated 19 th September, 1999 is a 
void instrument. 
3.4 An application under Section 124 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 , 
being I .A. 311/2017, was filed on behalf of the defendant , whereby 
permission was sought from the Court to institute appropriate 
proceedings for revocation/cancellation of the plaintiff’s trademarks 
before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) and for stay 
of the present suit. 
3.5 Issues were framed in the suit on 29 th April, 2019 and an observation 
was made by the Court that si nce no issue with regard to validity of 
the marks of the plaintiff was framed, I.A. 311/2017 was liable to be

dismissed. However, the matter was listed on 26 th November, 2019 
for arguments on I.A. 311/2017. 
3.6 In the order dated 26th November, 2019 passed by this Court, it was 
noted that the defendant was not pressing  I.A. 311/2017 and 
consequently, the said application was dismissed as not pressed.  
3.7 In the year 202 2, various rectification petitions , including C.O. 
(COMM.IPD-TM) 100/2022,  were filed on behalf of the defendant 
seeking cancellation of the registrations granted in favour of the 
trademark “DEHLVI”.  
3.8 On 19 th September, 2022, another rectification petition filed by the 
petitioner in respect of the trademark “DEHLVI”, being C.O. 
(COMM.IPD-TM) 100/2022 , was withdrawn by the 
petitioner/defendant with liberty to file the petition afresh, after taking 
appropriate steps in the present suit. 
3.9 Accordingly, the defendant has filed the present application on 8 th 
October, 2022 for framing additional issues as aforesaid.   
4. Counsel for the defendant has drawn attention of the Court to the 
pleadings in the written statement to contend that necessary averments have 
been made with regard to the invalidity of registration s of the plaintiff’s 
trademarks and invalidity of the Assignment Deed granted in favour of the 
plaintiff. Therefore, issues in this regard are required to be framed. He 
submits that the withdrawal of  the application under Section 124 of Trade 
Marks Act was on account of the fact that the defendant did no t want the 
present suit to be stayed. He further submits that with the coming into effect

of the Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021, the IPAB stands abolished and even the 
rectification applications have to be heard by this Court . T herefore, the 
rectification petitions filed by the defendant can be clubbed and tried along 
with the present suit and no prejudice would be caused to the plaintiff. 
5. Per contra , counsel for the plaintiff submits that the defendant was 
conscious that permission was required from the Court  before filing a 
rectification petition and accordingly filed I.A 311/2017 seeking permission 
of the Court. No issue with regard to the invalidity of the trademark s of the 
plaintiff was framed by this Court and I.A. 311/2017 was dismissed as not 
pressed. T herefore, the defendant has consciously chosen not to press the 
issue regarding the invalidity of plaintiff’s trademarks and under the garb of 
the present application, the defendant cannot raise the aforesaid issue again. 
Reliance is placed on  the judgment s in Shiv Prasad v. Durga Prasad & 
Anr., (1975) 1 SCC 405;  Anil Dinmani Shanker Joshi & Anr. v. Chief 
Officer, (2003) SCC OnLine BOM 24; Jaswant Rai & Ors. v. Municipality, 
Badthinda, (2014) SCC OnLine P&H 25276;  and, Krishna Saini v. 
Chameli Devi &Ors., (2011) SCC OnLine Del 2258 (DB). 
6. I have heard the rival submissions  and examined the record of the 
case. 
7. In Patel Field Marshal Agencies v. P.M. Diesels Ltd., (2018) 2 SCC 
112, the Supreme Court observed that where , during the pendency of a suit, 
a rectification application is filed, the application can be pursued only upon 
a finding by the Civil Court on the prima facie  tenability of the plea of 
invalidity. If the Civil Court does not find a triable issue on the plea of 
invalidity, then the said application  cannot be pursued. The Supreme Court

noted that this was necessary so as to avoid multiple proceedings on the 
same issue and the possibility of conflicting decisions. However, there have 
been subsequent developments since the passing of judgment in Patel Field 
Marshal Agencies (supra). In terms of the Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021, the 
IPAB has been abolished and the jurisdiction to decide rectification petitions 
now vests with the High Court under Section 21 of the Act. Therefore, now 
the suit as well as th e rectification applications have to be decided by one 
authority alone i.e. the High Court and resultantly, there cannot be any 
possibility of conflicting decisions. Hence, the rectification petitions can be 
clubbed with the civil suits and there is no req uirement of staying the civil 
suit. 
8. In Abbott Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. v. Raj Kumar Prasad & Anr. , 2018 
SCC OnLine Del 6657, a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court was seized of a 
similar application filed on behalf of the plaintiff seeking framing of an 
additional issue with regard to validity of the registration of the defendant’s 
trademark. In the said suit, i ssues were framed prior to the filing of the 
Section 124 application  and no issue with regard to invalidity of the 
defendant’s trademark had been urged or f ramed. Noting that no issue with 
regard to validity of the impugned trademark was framed in the suit , the 
application filed on behalf of the plaintiff under Section 124 of the Trade 
Marks Act, 1999 was subsequently dismissed by the Court  with the liberty 
to apply afresh in the event additional issues were framed in the suit . 
Relying on the dicta of  S. Surjit Singh Sahni v. Brij Mohan Kaur , (1997) 
65 DLT 670, the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court observed that framing of 
issues is the duty of the Court and rej ection of an earlier prayer does not

debar a fresh prayer for framing an issue if it arises from the pleadings and 
ought to have been framed but has inadvertently not been framed. The 
relevant observations of the Court in Abbott Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. (supra) are 
set out below: 
“12. The counsel for the plaintiff, in rejoinder, refers to S. 
Surjit Singh Sahni v. Brij Mohan Kaur 65 (1997) DLT 670 and 
on order dated 30th April, 2013 in CS(OS) No. 1457/2009 titled 
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. v. Intas Pharmaceutical s Ltd. and 
against which no appeal is stated to have been preferred, holding 
that framing of issues is the duty of the Court and rejection of an 
earlier prayer does not debar a fresh prayer for framing an issue 
if it arises from the pleadings and ought to have been framed 
and has mistakenly not been framed.  It is argued that the Court, 
at the time of framing of issues on 21st March, 2016, has not 
applied its mind and not refused to frame the issue about 
invalidity. It is thus contended that the plaintiff ca n apply for 
framing of additional issue. 
13. I tend to agree with the counsel for plaintiff. The Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), vide Order XIV Rule 5 empowers 
the Court to, at any time before passing a decree, amend the 
issues or frame additional iss ues and provides that all such 
amendments or additional issues as may be necessary for 
determining the maters in controversy between the parties shall 
be so made or framed. Thus, merely because at the time of 
framing of issues, an issue though arising from  pleadings, has 
not been pressed and/or framed would not stop a subsequent 
application. The position may be different where an issue is 
pressed and not framed by a speaking order. In such case, the 
bar of res judicata, also applicable at successive stages of same 
proceeding, may come in way of an application under Order XIV 
Rule 5 CPC. However, in the present case, a perusal of order 
dated 21st March, 2016, when issues were framed, does not show 
any such thing.”

9. The facts in Abbott Healthcare (supra) are s imilar to that of  the 
present case. In the said case, the Court dismissed the Section 124 
application as no issue had been framed with regard to invalidity of the 
trademark. In the present case  also, no issue was framed by the Court  with 
regard to invalidi ty of the registrations of the plaintiff’s marks and t he 
defendant withdrew the application filed under Section 124  of the Trade 
Marks Act, 1999 . However, like in Abbott Healthcare (supra), as per the 
order dated 19 th September, 2022 in C.O. (COMM.IPD -TM) 100/2022, 
liberty was given to the defendant herein to apply for framing of additional 
issues.  
10. Therefore, what has to be examined is whether the defendant has 
made the necessary averments in the written statement with regard to the 
invalidity of the plaintiff’s trademarks so as to frame an issue in this regard. 
11. A perusal of the written statement filed on behalf of the defendant 
shows that defendant has pleaded that ; (i) the plaintiff company came into 
existence only on 21 st October, 1997, whereas the defendant has been using 
the trademark “DEHLVI” since 1995 (page 17 of the written statement); (ii) 
the plaintiff claims rights in the trademark “DEHLVI” only on the basis of 
the Assignment Deed dated 19th September, 1999, which is invalid and void 
ab initio (pages 12 and 17 of the written statement); and, (iii) the registration 
obtained by the plaintiff is on the basis of false user and therefore , the 
registered trademarks of the plaintiff are liable to be cancelled and pending  
registration applications liable to be refused (paragraph 24, page 22 of the 
written statement).

12. A holistic reading of the written statement leads me to conclude that 
the defendant has made necessary pleadings with regard to (i) invalidity of 
the Assignment Deed dated 19 th September, 1999; and (ii) the invalidity of 
the trademark registrations granted in favour of the plaintiff.  These are 
material propositions of fact in terms of Order XIV Rule 1 of the CPC and 
therefore, an issue ought to have been framed with regard to the same. 
13. It is the settled position of law that it is the obligation of the Court to 
frame issues. In this regard reference may be made to paragraph 7 of the S. 
Surjit Singh Sahni (supra): 
“7. A perusal of the several provisions contained in Order 14 
of the CPC would be ap posite. An issue arises when a material 
proposition of fact or law is affirmed by one party and denied by 
the other. Every such proposition shall form the subject of a 
distinct issue. Primarily it is the obligation of the Court to frame 
the issues. Failure  on the part of the Court may be remedied by 
either party inviting attention of the Court to the need of framing 
such an issue either by participating in the process of settlement 
of issues or by moving an application under Order 14 Rule 5 of 
the CPC. It i s obligatory on the part of the Court to frame an 
issue once it is satisfied that an issue which should have been 
framed was not framed. If the trial court fails in framing an 
issue or fails to remedy its earlier failure then even an appellate 
court is vested with power of framing an issue under Rule 25 of 
Order 41 of the CPC.” 
[emphasis supplied] 
14. In light of the dicta above , even if the counsel for the defendant did 
not press for framing of the issues  sought to be framed  now, it would not 
mean that the Cou rt cannot, at a subsequent stage, frame such  issues if they 
emerge from the pleadings in the suit. The language of Order XIV Rule 5 of

the CPC is very wide and empowers the Court to amend the issues so 
framed or frame additional issues at any time before p assing of the final 
decree. 
15. In any event, if the counsel for the defendant did not press for framing 
of additional issues that are subject matter of the present application and also 
did not press the application under Section 124 of the Trade Mark s Act, the 
defendant cannot be made to suffer . It has been held in Teva 
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. & Ors. v. Natco Pharma Limited , (2014) 
210 DLT 591 (DB) , which has been followed in Abbott Healthcare (supra) 
that a litigant ought not to suffer on account of acts of his advocate. 
16. The judgments relied upon b y counsel for the plaintiff was  in an 
entirely different factual context and therefore, would not be applicable to 
the facts and circumstances of the present case. 
17. There is another aspect of the matter . In the earlier regime, upon an 
issue being framed with regard to invalidity of a trademark, proceedings in 
the civil suit were stayed in order that for the statutory authority i.e. IPAB to 
decide. With the coming into effect of the Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021, and 
the consequent abolition of the IPAB, this situation does not exist  anymore. 
Therefore, even if an issue with regard to invalidity of a trademark is framed 
by the civil court and rectification applications are filed by a litigant, the 
civil suit is not liable to be stayed. The rectification petitions/applications  
can be clubbed and tried along with the civil suit. Therefore, no prejudice 
would be cause d to the plaintiff if the additional issue s, as sought to be 
framed by way of the present application, are framed.

18. Accordingly, the present application is allowed and the following 
additional issues are framed: 
I. Whether the registration of the trademarks with the name and style of 
"Dehlvi", either independently or as supporting word, as mentioned in 
paragraph 12 of the plaint, in favour of the Plaintiff, are invalid and

5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid injunction order, the defendants filed
I.A.16402/2022. Notice in this application was issued on 10 th October, 2022
and reply thereto has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff.
SUBMISSIONS OF THE DEFENDANTS
6. The counsel for the defendants made the following submissions:
6.1 It has wrongly been stated in the plaint that the plaintiff learnt of the
defendants’ use of the impugned marks in August, 2022 and have
approached the Court without any delay. As is evident from the legal notice
dated 17 th August, 2020, the plaintiff was aware of the user of the mark
‘AIVVA’ in August, 2020 by the defendants no.1 and 2, who were selling
and marketing their products under the mark ‘AIVVA’ and the said products
are also available for purchase on e-commerce platforms like IndiaMART.
6.2 The plaintiff has deliberately not disclosed the legal notice or its reply
in the plaint.
6.3 A reading of the aforesaid legal notice shows that the plaintiff was
Digitally Signed

2023/DHC/000041
CS(COMM) 606/2022 Page 5 of 15
aware about the use of the ‘AIVVA’ trademark by Mr. Ajjaay Advani as
well as the registrations of the trademark ‘AIVVA’ in his favour in the year
2015.
6.4 The aforesaid legal notice was copied to a Hong Kong based entity,
Nu-World Global, which has been described in paragraph 2 of the aforesaid
notice as an entity to which rights to manufacture and sell products under the
‘AIWA’ trademark have been assigned by the plaintiff. Further, the
aforesaid Nu-World Global assigned the rights in favour of Aiwa Consumer
Products LLP, a partnership firm in India on whose behalf the aforesaid
legal notice was sent. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot claim ignorance of the
aforesaid legal notice. This fact has also been stated in paragraph 5 (ii) of
I.A. 16402/2022 and no specific denial thereto has been made on behalf of
the plaintiff.
6.5 It has further been stated in the aforesaid legal notice that the
defendants no.1 and 2 are acting in connivance with Mr. Ajjaay Advani. The
aforesaid legal notice was duly replied to on behalf of Mr. Ajjaay Advani,
wherein it was stated that the mark ‘AIVVA’ has been registered by him
under Classes 7, 9 and 11 as far back as in December, 2015. It was also
stated in the reply that the domain name ‘ www.aivva.com’ has been
registered by Mr. Ajjaay Advani in February, 2017.
6.6 The plaintiff was aware of the registration of the mark ‘AIVVA’ in
favour of Mr. Ajjaay Advani but has failed to challenge the same. Despite
alleging connivance between Mr. Ajjaay Advani and the defendants, Mr.
Ajjaay Advani has not been made a party in the suit.
6.7 In the affidavit filed on behalf of Mr. Ajjaay Advani filed along with
the written statement, it has been stated that Mr. Ajjaay Advani has given

permission to the defendants no.1 and 2 to use the trademark ‘AIVVA’.
6.8 No written authorization was required to be given by a registered
proprietor of a trademark for use of the aforesaid trademark. Reliance in this
regard is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Cycle
Corporation of India Ltd. v. T.I. Raleigh Industries Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. ,
(1996) 9 SCC 430.
6.9 It has wrongly been stated in the plaint that the defendants have been
selling TVs under the mark ‘AIWA’ as the defendants have only been
selling TVs under the mark ‘AIVVA’. Reliance has been placed on the
various invoices of the defendants from May, 2016 in this regard.
6.10 No documents have been filed on behalf of the plaintiff showing user
of the trademark ‘AIWA’ prior to the user of the defendants. On the other
hand, defendants have filed invoices to show their user of the trademark
‘AIVVA’ since 2016.
7. Counsel for the defendants has also placed reliance on the judgments
in Micolube India Ltd. v. Maggon Auto Centre &Anr., 2008 (36) PTC 231
(Del.), Thukral Mechanical Works v. Nitin Machine Tools P. Ltd. &Anr. ,
(1998) 18 PTC 767, Standipack Private Limited &Ors. v. Oswal Trading

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF
8. Per contra, counsel for the plaintiff made the following submissions:
8.1 The plaintiff duly conducted a search of the Trademark Registry

8.2 The defendant companies have failed to show that they have a license
or any other written authorization in their favour from Mr. Ajjaay Advani.
There is nothing to suggest that the defendants are rel

8.3 The very premise of the application under Order XXXIX Rule 4 of
the CPC is based on a wrong assumption that the legal notice dated 17
August, 2020 was sent on behalf of the plaintiff.
8.4 The aforesaid notice was neither sent by t
plaintiff, nor did the plaintiff have any knowledge about the aforesaid notice
being sent to Mr. Ajjaay Advani.
8.5 The present suit has been filed only against the defendants no.1 and 2
as it is the said defendants who were selli

8.6 The use and adoption of the trademarks ‘AIVVA’,
and

but also an attempt to ride on the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff’s
well-known trademark.

8.8 In their brochure, the defendant no.1 is also using the word ‘aiwa’ as a
part of its email address.
8.9 The reliance placed by the defendants on the affidavit of Mr. Ajjaay
Advani is completely misplaced as the aforesaid affidavit is dated 29 th
September, 2022, after the interim order was passed by this Court on 1 st
September, 2022.
8.10 In terms of Section 2(1)(r)(ii) of the Trade Marks Act,
1999,‘permitted user can only be by way of a written agreement’. The
defendants have failed to place on record any written agreement between
them and Mr. Ajjaay Advani permitting the use of the trademark ‘AIWA’ by
the defendants with effect from 2015.
8.11 Reliance placed on the judgment in Raleigh Industries (supra) is
misplaced as the aforesaid judgment was under the Trade and Merchandise
Marks Act, 1958 (old Act). In any case, the defendants have failed to show
an unbroken trade connection between the defendants and Mr. Ajjaay
Advani and therefore, the judgment in Raleigh Industries (supra) is not
applicable.
8.12 The defendants in their brochure have wrongly claimed registration of
the mark ‘AIVVA’, when in fact, they were not the registered proprietors of
the aforesaid trademark. In any event, the defendants were not authorized to
use the stylized imitation of the plaintiff’s trademark as there was no
registration in respect of such stylized version.
ANALYSIS & FINDINGS

counsels appearing on behalf of the parties.

10. Since the case of the defendants is primarily premised on the legal
notice dated 17th August, 2020, I propose to deal with the same first.
11. The aforesaid legal notice has been sent on behalf of one Aiwa
Consumer Products LLP, a partnership firm having its corporate office at A-
62, Naraina Industrial Area, Phase-I, New Delhi-110028. There is nothing
on record to suggest any connection of the aforesaid entity with the plaintiff
company or the fact that the plaintiff company was aware of sending of the
aforesaid legal notice.
12. Counsel for the defendants has vehemently submitted that the term
‘my client’ in the aforesaid notice would include the principals of the entity
sending the notice. However, nothing has been placed on record to show that
the plaintiff company is the principal of the aforesaid entity. Merely because
the entity sending the legal notice uses the name ‘AIWA’ or that the plaintiff
company has not initiated any legal action against the aforesaid entity for
having sent the legal notice using the name of the plaintiff company, it
cannot be contended that the aforesaid notice was sent with the knowledge
and consent of the plaintiff company. It was for the defendants to show that
there was a connection between the said entity and the plaintiff company or
that the plaintiff company was aware of the aforesaid legal notice.
13. Once again, the fact that the aforesaid legal notice is copied to Nu-
World Global, who is stated to be an assignee of the plaintiff company,
would not be sufficient to attribute knowledge of the aforesaid legal notice
to the plaintiff company. To make good the allegations of suppression and
concealment, the defendants would have to show that it was within the
knowledge of the plaintiff company that the aforesaid legal notice was sent
on their behalf. This has not been done in the present case and therefore, I do

CS(COMM) 606/2022 Page 10 of 15
not find merit in the submission of the defendants that the plaintiff was
aware of the legal notice or that they had deliberately suppressed the
aforesaid legal notice in order to obtain an ex parte ad interim injunction
against the defendants.
14. In view of the above, there is no reason to disbelieve the submission
made in the plaint that the plaintiff company became aware of the
defendants no.1 and 2 infringing its trademark only in August, 2022, upon
coming across the brochure of the defendants and soon thereafter, the
present suit was filed. In other words, there is no basis to contend that the
interim order passed by this Court on 2nd September, 2022 was passed on the
account of concealment and suppression on behalf of the plaintiff or that
there was any delay on behalf of the plaintiff in filing the present suit. In
view thereof, the judgments relied upon by the defendants in respect of
concealment i.e., Micolube India Ltd. (supra), Thukral Mechanical Works
(supra), Standipack Private Limited (supra) and Kent Ro System Ltd.
(supra) would not have any application to the facts and circumstances of the
present case. Further, the judgment in B.L. and Co. (supra) in respect of
delay would also be of no aid to the defendants.
15. A perusal of the Company Master Data in respect of the defendant
no.1 and 2 companies, as available on the website of Registrar of Companies
(ROC), would show that Mr. Ajjaay Advani is neither a Director, nor a
shareholder of the defendant companies. Nor have the defendants placed any
license or other document assigning the mark ‘AIVVA’ in their favour from
Mr. Ajjaay Advani so as to justify their use of the said mark. Therefore, the
reliance placed by the defendants on the registration granted in favour of Mr.
Ajjaay Advani is completely misplaced.

Advani. By way of the aforesaid affidavit, a right cannot be created in
favour of the defendants to use the trademark ‘AIVVA’ retrospectively.
Clearly, the aforesaid affidavit has been executed at this belated stage only
to support the defendants in the present case. In this regard, reference may
be made to Section 2(1)(r)(ii) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, which defines
“permitted use” as under:
“(r) “permitted use”, in relation to a registered trade mark,
means the use of trade mark—

plaintiff has also placed on record sufficient material to demonstrate prior
use of the trademarks in India. The defendants’ use of the impugned marks
is prima facie dishonest and nothing but attempt to ride on the goodwill and
reputation of the plaintiff’s marks as also to cause confusion in the market.
25. In view of the above, the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case in
its favour. Balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff. Irreparable
harm would be caused not only to the plaintiff but also to the public if the
defendants are not injuncted from using the impugned trademarks.

erstwhile Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), however, due to the 
enactment of the  Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021, the petitions have been 
placed before this Court. 
2. Notice in the aforesaid rectification petitions was  issued by the IPAB 
on 8th February, 2019. Counter statements thereto have been filed on behalf 
of the respondent  no.1 and rejoinder has been filed on behalf of the 
petitioner company. 
3. Since all the three petitions raise similar issues, they are being decided 
by way of a common judgment. 
BRIEF FACTS 
4. Briefly, the case set up by the petitioner company is as under: 
4.1 The pe titioner company, incorporated in Japan , is an automotive 
manufacturer and operates throughout the world.  The vehicles of the 
petitioner company are sold in more than 170 countries and the 
petitioner company conducts business worldwide with 53 overseas 
manufacturing companies in 28 countries and regions.

„ALPHARD‟ has not yet been form ally launched in India, the same 
has been available in the country for the last many years on account of 
direct import s by Indian residen ts. The earliest registration of the 
petitioner company‟s mark „ALPHARD‟ dates back to 1986 and the 
said trade  mark is registered in various jurisdictions, such as Japan, 
China, Singapore etc.   
4.5 The petitioner company has sold more than 8,50,000 units under the 
trade mark „ALPHARD‟ since its launch in 2002.  The details of sales 
figures as well as advertising and promotional expenses incurred by 
the petitioner company from 2002 -2017 ha ve been given in the 
petition. 
4.6 The petitioner  company‟s trade  mark „ALPHARD‟ is well -known 
throughout the world and ha s acquired a secondary meaning with the 
people associated with the trade associating the same with the 
petitioner. 
4.7 The petitioner company applied for registration of the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ on a „ proposed to be used basis ‟ on 21st November, 
2017 and the same has been objected to by the Registry.  
4.8 The respondent no.1 obtained registration of the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ under Classes 9, 12 and 27 on 5th November, 2015 on a 
„proposed to be used basis‟. 
4.9 Adoption of the petitioner  company‟s trade  mark by the respondent 
no.1 in relation to goods in the allied/cognate field has been done in a 
mala fide  manner so as to trade upon the  petitioner company‟s 
goodwill and reputation.

summarized as under: 
5.1 Respondent no.1 is the prior user and bona fide adopter of the trade  
mark „ALPHARD‟ for goods under Class es 9, 12 and 27 since the 
year 2015. 
5.2 The respondent no.1 coined and adopted the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
in the year 2015 and since its adoption , the respondent no.1 has been 
continuously and extensively using the said trade mark. 
5.3 The aforesaid trade mark has been used by the respo ndent no.1 along 
with its sister companies, „Tekstar Global Private Limited ‟ and „Sai 
Supertrek Global Private Limited‟.    
5.4 Though the petitioner company applied for the registration of its trade 
mark „ALPHARD in Class 12 , it is an admitted position that t he 
petitioner company has not used the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in India. 
5.5 In light of the non -user by the petitioner  Company, there cannot be 
any goodwill or transborder reputation in respect of the aforesaid 
trade mark in India.   
5.6 The petitioner company has made contradictory claims in its petition.  
On one hand, the petitioner company claims that the petitioner ‟s 
vehicles under the aforesaid trade mark were available in India from 
the year 2008 , on the other hand, the trade mark  registration 
application has b een filed by the petitioner company on a „ proposed 
to be used basis‟ in November, 2017.

6.1 Vehicles bearing the petitioner  company‟s trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
have been sold in India as far back as 2008.  Reliance is placed on 
printouts from third -party websites showing listings of the petitioner  
company‟s vehicles in India for sale. 
6.2 Petitioner company‟s trade mark „ALPHARD‟ enjoys a world wide 
reputation and the same has a direct spillover in India. In this regard, 
petitioner company has placed on record international 
brochures/annual reports, awards, worldwide trade mark registration 
certificates/renewal certificates and promotional material in respect of 
the mark „ALPHARD‟.  
6.3 The invoices placed on record on behalf of the respondent no.1 are 
not of the respondent no.1  company but of „ Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟.   
6.4 Registration could not have been granted to the respondent no.1  in 
terms of Sections 11(1), 11(2), 11(3) and 11(10) of the Trade Marks 
Act, 1999 (hereinafter „the Act‟).

trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in  India in  any of the three classes  viz., 
Class 9, Class 12 and Class 27, where the mark has been registered in 
favour of the respondent no.1. Further, the trade mar k „ALPHARD‟ 
has not been used by the petitioner company in Classes 9 or 27 even 
outside India. 
7.2 The products of the respondent no.1 have been continuously sold 
under the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ since the year 2015.  Reliance in 
this regard is placed on the inv oices of „Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟, sister company of the respondent no.1.   
7.3 The word „ALPHARD‟ is the name of a star and therefore, the same 
has been adopted by the respondent no.1 in a bona fide manner.  Its 
use in relation to car accessories is completely arbitrary and fanciful.  
7.4 The provisions of Section s 11(1), 11(2) and 11(3) of the Act have no 
application in the present case as there is no earlier registered trade 
mark in the present case.   
7.5 Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Co urt in Toyota

for determining transnational reputation. It was the case of Toyota that the 
car under the brand  „Prius‟ was launched in Japan in 1997 and in other 
countries in 2000 -2001. However, „Prius‟ was released in India in the year 
2009 and formally launched in the year 2010.  The respondent (defendant in 
the suit), had got the mark „Prius‟ registered in India in 2002  in respect of 
auto parts and accessories  and was using the said mark in India since 2001. 
A suit for  infringement of the mark „Prius‟ and  passing off was filed by 
Toyota against the respondent. After a full trial, a Single Judge of this Court 
held that the acts of the respondent amounted to passing off of the 
respondent‟s goods under the trade name „Prius‟ and consequently granted a 
permanent injunction in favour of the plaintiff . In appeal, the Division 
Bench reversed the judgment of the Single Judge and declined the relief of 
permanent injunction. This was challenged by Toyota before the Supreme 
Court.  
10. Relying upon the judgments of the Courts in the U.K. and Australia 
and the passages from the book „ The Law of Passing -Off‟ by Prof. 
Christopher Wadlow, the Supreme Court applied the „territoriality 
principle‟ and held that the transnational reputation of Toyota in respect of 
the trade mark 'Prius‟ has not spilled over to India and hence, did not grant 
permanent injunction in favour of Toyota . The relevant observations of the 
Supreme Court with regard to the application of the „territoriality principle‟ 
are set out below: 
“32.  Prof. Cristopher Wadlow's view on the subject appears to 
be that the test of whether a foreign claimant may succeed in a 
passing-off action is whether his business has a goodwill in a 
particular jurisdiction, which criterion is broader than the 
“obsolete” t est of whether a claimant has a business/place of

business in that jurisdiction. If there are customers for the 
claimant's products in that jurisdiction, then the claimant stands 
in the same position as a domestic trader. 
 
33.  The overwhelming judicial and academic opinion all over 
the globe, therefore, seems to be in favour of the territoriality 
principle. We do not see why the same should not apply to this 
country. 
 
34.  To give effect to the territoriality principle, the courts 
must necessarily have to determine if there has been a spillover 
of the reputation and goodwill of the mark used by the claimant 
who has brought the passing -off action. In the course of such 
determination it may be necessary to seek and ascertain the 
existence of not necessarily a  real market but the presence of 
the claimant through its mark within a particular territorial 
jurisdiction in a more subtle form which can best be manifested 
by the following illustrations, though they arise from decisions of 
courts which may not be final in that particular jurisdiction.” 
 
11. Applying the aforesaid principle s to the facts of the case before the 
Supreme Court in Toyota (supra), it was observed as under: 
(i) Undoubtedly, t he trade mark „Prius‟ has acquired a great deal of 
goodwill in various other jurisdictions in the world before  its use and 
registration by the respondent in India. 
(ii) Merely on account of advertisements in automobile magazines, 
international business magazines and information on the internet, it 
cannot be said that the aforesaid produ ct has acquired the necessary 
goodwill and reputation in the Indian market. 
(iii) The evidence on record also showed very limited sale s of the product 
in the Indian market and no advertisement prior to the registration by 
the defendant.

(iv) The plaintiff failed to f urnish sufficient proof of knowledge and 
information about the product in India. 
(v) The brand name of the car „Prius‟ had not acquired the degree of 
goodwill, reputation and popularity in the Indian market so as to 
create a right of prior user in favour of To yota against a registered 
owner. 
12.  To a similar effect is the order of the IPAB in Hypnos Limited  
(supra).  In the said case, the applicant was the registered proprietor of the 
mark „Hypnos‟, adopted several decades ago in relation to beds , mattresses, 
pillows, etc.  It was also the case of the applicant that beds bearing the trade 
mark „Hypnos‟ had been supplied by the applicant to hotels in India in the 
years 2008 to 2010.  The respondent‟s trade mark was registered in Class 20 
in the year 2007. It was the  case of the applicant that the respondent had 
dishonestly adopted and obtained registration of the trade mark „Hypnos‟ in 
India and started using the same for selling similar goods. Rejecting the 
submission of the applicant that the impugned trade mark „H ypnos‟ is a 
„well-known trademark‟ and carries transborder reputation , which has 
spilled over to India, the IPAB dismissed the rectification petition. The 
relevant observations are as under: 
“81.  We agree with the proposition propounded in the 
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court on same issue, wherein the 
Hon'ble Apex court has held that in the case of  National Sewing 
Thread Co. Ltd. v. James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd. (Supra). 
 
“Wherein the Hon'ble court has taken view that “the suit of 
passing-off and the oppos ition proceedings pending before 
the Registrar of Trademarks are different from each other”. 
 
82.  We are also of the same opinion as this proposition lay

down in above judgment that the rectification proceeding under 
section 57 of the trademarks Act is al so altogether quite 
different from the suit of passing off or of opposition 
proceedings before the Registrar . The rectification proceedings 
before the board under section 57 of the trademarks Act cannot 
be equated to be similar with as in the case of passi ng off action, 
where the burden rests on the plaintiff to prove whether there is 
likelihood of the defendant's goods being passed off as the goods 
of the plaintiff but in rectification proceedings under section 57 
of the trademarks Act it deals with the po wer to cancel or vary 
registration on many grounds and to expunge the trademark from 
the register is based on different tenets altogether not as in the 
case suit for passing off, as such the rectification application also 
has inherent different structure in totality than the suit of passing 
off. 
 
83.  To claim Trans -border reputation for a mark in India, 
the impugned trademark ‘Hypnos’ must be well known 
substantial segment of consumers in India must know about the 
existence of the mark of the foreign entit y. Such knowledge 
may come from free availability of the product to Indian 
consumers or extensive advertising, which reaches a 
substantial segment of Indian consumers because of extensive 
circulation of those advertisements in India. 
 
84.  After going thro ugh the pleading and rival contention 
of the parties. We have observed that even assuming the 
applicant's trademark acquired reputation in foreign countries, 
where their trade mark is registered, but no presumption can be 
drawn at this juncture that trade mark of the applicant 
registered in foreign countries has automatically acquired 
reputation in India or trans -border reputation is percolated in 
India, as we have already pointed out that no document of the 
applicant shows of its extensive usage of the mar k in India or 
any other place of registration. 
 
85.  The applicant has failed to establish that indeed the 
applicant has trans -border reputation due to its long and

extensive use of the impugned trademark in question and the 
impugned trademark „Hypnos‟ is well known. The applicant has 
further failed to establish that the trademark “Hypnos” has 
attained the reputation and goodwill which has spilled over in to 
other countries and India. The substantial segments of consumers 
in India know about the existence o f the mark „Hypnos‟ as of the 
foreign entity. 
 
86.  It is well settled proposition that the onus is on the 
applicant applying rectification to establish by letting his 
evidence about the trans -border reputation, so the burden is on 
the applicant herein, th e applicant has to discharge his burden 
by showing extensive use and making out strong ground for 
rectification. The applicant applying for rectification application 
has to discharge its onus in removing of registered trademark 
from register.

88. We have also gone through the authorities submitted by the 
respondent in  support of his contention. We agree with 
propounded proposition in the above citations  that the onus is 
on the applicant to discharge by producing substantial evidence 
in his  support and it is burden on the applicant to establish 
evidence of extensive, long use  of its mark and show the well 
knownness, trans -border reputation and making out  strong 
ground for rectification.” 
 
13. In light of the principle s laid down in the aforesaid judgments, it has 
to be examined whether in the present case , the petitioner  company has 
produced sufficient evidence on record in support of its contention that the 
trade mark „ALPHARD‟  carries a transborder reputation that has spilled 
over in India.   
14. Merely, the international usage of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ by the 
petitioner company is not sufficient to prove the spillover of its transnational

reputation in India.  In the present case, the petitioner company has failed to 
place on record a single invoice to show that it has sold any car under the 
brand „ALPHARD‟ in India. In fact, the trade mark application filed on 
behalf of the petitioner company in November, 2017 was on a „proposed to 
be used basis ‟. It is petitioner  company‟s own case that the same model of 
the car has been launched in India under a different brand name, „Vellfire‟.  
15. It is also an admitted position that the petitioner company has not 
advertised the said brand in India in any manner. Various documents placed 
on record by the petitioner company such as, international brochures/annual 
reports, awards, worldwide trade mark registration certificates/renewal 
certificates and promotional material, are in relation to international usage of 
the aforesaid trade mark. Undoubtedly, these documents show that the trade 
mark „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and reputation in several other 
jurisdictions around the world. However, as per the „territoriality principle‟, 
the onus is on the petitioner company to show that the trade  mark 
„ALPHARD‟ had acquired sufficient goodwill and reputation in the Indian 
market also. None of the aforesaid documents filed by the petitioner 
company show s that the brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and 
reputation in India. The documents filed by the petitioner company relating 
to India are screenshots from third-party websites showing that a few cars of 
the petitioner company under the brand „ALPHARD‟ have been listed for 
sale in India. As per the import -export data of India filed on behalf of the 
petitioner company, only fifteen import shipment record s have been found  
under the brand „ALPHARD‟ between the years 2014 to 2016  and not all of 
them are in respect of vehicles . It may be noted that the aforesaid imports 
have not been made by the petitioner company itself but by private parties.

16. The petitioner company has filed certain articles in various 
trade/automobile magazines and newspaper reports regarding the petitioner 
company considering the launch of a vehicle under the brand „ALPHARD‟ 
in India . However, most of these articles are after the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ had already been registered by the respondent no.1 in India. It 
is also to be noted that the vehicle under the brand „ALPHARD‟ was never 
launched in India. The same model was launched in India in February, 2020 
under the brand „Vellfire‟. Therefore, no reliance can be placed on these 
articles to show that the brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and 
reputation in India.  
17. In Toyota (supra), the „Prius‟ model had been introduced by Toyota in 
the India n market in 2009 -2010 and there were advertisements in 
automobile magazines. Despite this, taking note of limited sale s of the 
product in India and the absence of any advertisement of the product in India 
prior to 2001, the Supreme Court held that the trad e mark „Prius‟ cannot be 
said to have acquired goodwill and reputation in the Indian market. The 
present case stands on a worse footing for the petitioner company, as in the 
present case the petitioner company has neither launched the model under 
the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in India nor has advertised the same.  
18. Counsel for the petitioner company has placed reliance on the 
judgments in MAC Personal Care  (supra) and Keller Williams Realty 
(supra) in support of his submission that the transborder reputation in respect 
of a trade mark may have a spillover reputation in India as well, despite the 
aforesaid brand not having a commercial use in India. In MAC Personal 
Care (supra), the D ivision Bench enlisted the principles for determining 
international reputation. Ho wever, the issue of spillover of transnational

reputation in India was not before the Division Bench. These principles were 
laid down by the S upreme Court subsequently in Toyota (supra). Both the 
aforesaid judgments were in the context of passing off actio n and not in the 
context of rectification petitions. To be noted that in Keller Williams Realty 
(supra), the Co -ordinate Bench of this Court denied the relief of interim 
injunction in a passing of f action. One of the reasons for denial of interim 
injunction was that the plaintiff therein had been unable to show spillover of 
its reputation a nd goodwill in India. Therefore, the reliance place d by the 
petitioner company on the aforesaid judgments is misplaced.  
19. As regards the contention of the petitioner company that the adoption 
of the mark „ALPHARD‟  by the respondent no.1 is mala fide, counsel for 
the respondent no.1 has drawn  the attention of the Court to the dictionary 
meaning of the word „Alphard‟1.  The word „Alphard‟ has been described in 
the following manner: 
“an orange star of the second magnitude that is the brightest star 
in the constellation Hydra 
Hydra is actually the largest constellation. Despite its size, it has 
only one bright star named  Alphard. It can be found over in the 
southwest sky all by itself—hence the name, which in Arabic 
means "the solitary one.” 
 
20. Except for making a bald averment, the petitioner company has failed 
to place any material on record to show that the adoption by the respondent 
no.1 was mala fide. Therefore, on the basis o f evidence on record, it cannot 
be held that the adoption of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟  by the respondent 
no.1 was mala fide or in bad faith.

21. Reliance has been placed by the petitioner company on Section 11(1), 
11(2) and 11(3) of the Act to contend that the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
should not have been granted registration in favour of the respondent  no.1 
on account of its identity and similarity with an “ earlier trade mark ”. To 
appreciate this submission, a reference may be made to the relevant 
provisions of Section 11 of the Act, which is set out as under: 
“11. Relative grounds for refusal of registration. — (1) Save as 
provided in section 12, a trade mark shall not be registered if, 
because of— 
 
(a)  its identity with an earlier trade mark  and similarity of 
goods or services covered by the trade mark; or 
 
(b)  its similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or 
similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade mark,  
 
there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, 
which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade 
mark. 
 
(2)  A trade mark which— 
 
(a)  is identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark; and 
 
(b)  is to be registered for goods or serv ices which are not 
similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered in 
the name of a different proprietor,  
 
shall not be registered, if or to the extent, the earlier trade mark 
is a well-known trade mark in India and the use of the later ma rk 
without due cause would take unfair advantage of or be 
detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier 
trade mark.

that, its use in India is liable to be prevented— 
 
(a)  by virtue of any law in particular the law of passing off 
protecting an unregistered trade mark used in the course of 
trade; or 
 
(b)  by virtue of law of copyright. 
 
(4)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the registration of a 
trade mark where the proprietor of the earlier trade mark  or 
other earlier right consents to the registration, and in such case 
the Registrar may register the mark under special circumstances 
under section 12.  
 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, earlier trade 
mark means— 
 
(a)  a registered trade mark  or an application under Section 
18 bearing an earlier date of filing or an international 
registration referred to in Section 36E or convention application 
referred to in section 154 which has a date of applicat ion earlier 
than that of the trade mark in question, taking account, where 
appropriate, of the priorities claimed in respect of the trade 
marks; 
 
(b) a trade mark which, on the date of the application fo r 
registration of the trade mark in question , or where 
appropriate, of the priority claimed in respect of the application, 
was entitled to protection as a well-known trade mark.” 
 
22. The Explanation to Section 11  of the Act as set out above makes it 
clear that for the purposes of Section 11 of the Act, the phrase „earlier trade 
mark‟ would apply only in respect of a registered trade mark. Admittedly, 
the trade mark of the petitioner company was not registered in India at the 
time registration was granted in fa vour of the respondent no.1 . Therefore, 
the petitioner company cannot take benefit of sub-Sections (1) and (2) of

Section 11 of the Act. Even the ground of passing of f under sub-Section (3) 
of Section 11 of the Act would not be available to the petitioner company as 
it has failed to make out a case of having goodwill and reputation in India in 
respect of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟.  
23. Counsel for the petitioner company contends that the respondent no.1 
has failed to prov ide any evidence in respect of its use of  the trade  mark 
„ALPHARD‟. The various invoices filed by respondent no.1 to show the 
user of the aforesaid trade mark is by another entity, „Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟. In this regard, it may be noted that in the present case , registration 
has been obtained by the respondent no.1 on a „proposed to be used basis‟, 
which is permissible under Section 18 of the Act. Therefore, user on the date 
of registration would not be a relevant factor.  The respondent no.1 has 
placed on record various photographs of it s products bearing the trade mark 
„ALPHARD‟ as also invoices of its sister company , „Tekstar Global Private 
Limited‟ from 12th May, 2015 to 1st June, 2018 showing sales of products 
under the trade mark „ALPHARD‟.  Therefore, based  on the material on 
record, it cannot be established that the respondent no.1 has registered the 
trade mark without any bona fide intention to use the same.  
24. In view of the above, the petitioner company has completely failed to 
discharge the onus to show the reputation and goodwill of the mark 
„ALPHARD‟ in India . In fact, it  is not even the case of the petitioner 
company that it is dealing in products under Class 9 and Class 27 anywhere 
in the world. The documents placed on record by the petitioner company do  
not reflect extensive us e of the brand „ALPHARD‟ or establish that the 
brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired a transborder reputation in India in Classes 
9, 12 and 27. The evidence on record shows very limited sales and use of the

product in the Indian market and that too by private parti es. No 
advertisements have been made by the petitioner company in India. It cannot 
be stated that  a substantial number of consumers in India know about the 
existence of the brand „ALPHARD‟.  
25. Therefore, in my considered view, the petitioner company has fail ed 
to make out any ground for rectification of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ 
registered in Classes 9, 12 and 27 in the favour of the respondent no.1. I find 
no merit in the present rectification petitions filed on behalf of the petitioner 
company. Dismissed.

alia, the subject trademark is a unique combination  of words and is 
therefore, distinctive. 
iv. It was further stated that exclusivity was being claimed on the subject 
trademark as a whole and no exclusive proprietorship was being  
claimed on any of the descriptive elements of the mark. 
v. On 5th October, 2019, a hearing notice was  sent to the appellant and 
the hearing took place on 4 th December, 2019.  On 29 th November, 
2019, the appellant filed additional documents for the hearing. 
vi. Vide impugned order dated 5th August, 2020, the appellant’s 
application for registration of the subject trademark was rejected. 
6. Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the subject 
trademark cannot by any  stretch of imagination be termed as la udatory. He 
places reliance on the judgment of the Division Bench in Mohd. Rafiq v. 
Modi Sugar Mills Ltd., 1971 SCC OnLine Del 190. 
ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS  
7. I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the record. 
8. I am in agreement with the submission of the appellant that there is 
nothing laudatory about the subject trade mark. In any event, n o reasons or 
justifications have been given in the impugned order as to how the aforesaid 
trademark amounts to being laudatory. 
9. Counsel for the appellant has correctly placed reliance on the 
judgment in Mohd. Rafiq (supra), the relevant observations of which are set 
out below: 
“We are unable t o accede to the c ontention that the word “SUN” 
used in respect of the lanterns manufactured by the respondent is a 
laudatory term having reference to the character and quality of those

lanterns. It is no doubt true that the rays of s un dispel darkness and 
lanterns too are used for dispelling darkness, it does not follow from 
that that the use of tra de mark “SUN” for the lanterns has reference 
to the character and quality, of those lanterns. The reference to the 
character and quality, in our opinion, should be direct and pla in and 
not remote and far -fetched. Likewise, the word, which is sought to be 
construed as laudatory, should have obvious significant of praise, and 
not one out of which an inference of praise has to be s pelt out by a  
laboured process. Sun is the body which  is the gravitational centre 
and source of light and heat to our planetary sys tem. The element of 
praise is neith er self evident in the word “SUN” nor can the said 
word be considered to be descriptive of  the character or quality of the 
lanterns. A contrary  view must necessarily result in stretching the 
connotation of the word “sun” to limits which, in our opinion, ar e 
impermissible. We, therefore, find it difficult to hold that the word 
“sun” is inherentl y incapable o f being distinctive of the lanterns 
manufactured by the respondent. In the matter of  The Eastmen 
Photographic Material s Company, Limited  and The Comptrol ler-
General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks , 1898 A.C. 571 (5), the 
House of Lords hel d that the wo rd “Solio” when used in  respect of 
photographic paper was capable of registration as a trade mark. The 
contention that  the word indicated the character o r quality of the 
goods was repelled.” 
 
  
10. The subject trademark in the present case is a de vice mark, which is 
sought to be registered as a whole. The subject trademark is not a word mark 
simpliciter but a stylized device containing the t ext 'NRI Taxi' overlayed on 
a blue background with a partial outline of a side profile of a car . The same 
is required to b e assessed as a whole . Further, the subject trademark is 
neither descriptive nor generic in respect of the services it is being used for.  
11. In view of the above, the impugned order d ated 5 th August, 202 2 
refusing registration of the T rademark Application No.3547956 is 
unsustainable and is accordingly, set aside.

order was confirmed till the final adjudication of the present suit.  Appeal is 
stated to have been filed on behalf of the defendant, which is pending before 
the Division Bench of this Court. 
4. It was noted i n the order dated 18 th February, 2020 passed in the suit  
that one of the defences raised by the defendants in their written statement is 
that the plaintiff‟s registered trademark „BURGER KING‟ is liable to be 
cancelled. It was observed that the first question that is required to be 
adjudicated in the present case  is whether the case of the defendants on this 
account is prima facie tenable.  
5. Submissions on behalf of the parties on the aforesaid  aspect were 
heard on 16th January, 2023, 24th January, 2023 and 22nd February, 2023.  
6. Counsel appearing for the plaintiff has made the following 
submissions:  
I. In terms of Section 124(1)(b)(ii) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 
(hereinafter „Act‟), the Court shall raise an issue regarding the plea of 
invalidity of a registered trademark only upon  being satisfied that 
such a plea is prima facie tenable. F rom the date of framing of the 
said issue , the Court shall adjourn the case for a period of three 
months in order to enable the concerned party to apply for 
rectification of the register.  
II. It is necessary for the Court to determine the prima facie tenability of 
the plea of invalidity  of the registered trademark raised by the 
defendant in order to ensure that  the defendants do not institute 
rectification proceedings as a counter blast to the infringement actions 
filed against them. Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment s 
of the Supreme Court in Patel Field Marshal Agencies v. P.M.

Diesels Ltd , (2018) 2 SCC 112 and Abbott Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. v. 
Raj Kumar Prasad & Anr., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 6657. 
III. A total of 13 rectification petitions have been filed on behalf of the 
defendants seeking cancellation of the trademark registration s of the 
plaintiff, of which four are listed before this Court today. The 
remaining nine were filed before different be nches of Intellectual 
Property Appellate Board (IPAB) and are liable to be transferred 
before different High Courts after coming into effect of the Tribunals 
Reforms Act, 2021. 
IV. The grounds taken by the defendants in their written statement with 
regard to i nvalidity of the registration of the trademarks of the 
plaintiff are not tenable at all. The ground of „non -use‟ of the 
registered trademark of the plaintiff  taken by the defendants under 
Section 47 of the  Act, is not tenable as the defendants have failed to 
show that the plaintiff ha d an intention to abandon the use of their 
trademark in India. Reliance in this regard is placed on Hardie 
Trading Ltd. & Anr. v. Addissons Paint & Chemical Ltd. , (2003) 11 
SCC 92, and Express Bottlers Services Private Ltd. v. Pepsico Inc. & 
Ors., 1988 SCC OnLine Cal 62. 
V. Prior to the launch of BURGER KING restaurant in India in 
November, 2014, the plaintiff had taken various steps towards the 
launch of the said restaurant in India , which would constitute „use‟ 
under Section 47 of the Act. 
VI. The defendants are estopped from taking the defence that the 
trademark „BURGER KING‟ is generic and common to the trade and 
hence, cannot be registered as a trademark, as the defendants

themselves have applied for registration of the said tradem ark. 
Reliance in this re gard is placed on the judgment s of the Division 
Bench of this Court in Indian Hotels Company Limited & Anr. v. 
Jiva Institute of Vedic Science & Culture , 2008 SCC OnLine Del 
1758 and PEPS Industries Private Limited v. Kurlon Limited , 2022 
SCC OnLine 3275. 
VII. The plaintiff has used the trademark „BURGER KING‟ since 1954 
and the said mark has acquired secondary meaning and is exclusively 
associated with the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiff has obtained 
registrations of the trademark „BUR GER KING‟ in over 122 
countries. 
7. Counsel appearing for the defendants has made the following 
submissions: 
I. The defendant no.2 through its predecessor adopted the trademark 
BURGER KING in the year 1970. Since then the defendants have 
extensively used the said mark in respect of their business.  
II. The plaintiff has no exclusive right in the word „BURGER‟ as the 
same is generic and common to trade and the word „KING‟ is 
laudatory. Two generic/laudatory words cannot create a distinctive 
trademark. Therefore, the trademark „BURGER KING‟ cannot be 
registered. Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment in 
National Bell Co. v. Gupta Industrial Corporation , 1970 (3) SCC 
665.  
III. The registrations of the plaintiff are liable to be rectified on various 
grounds including on the ground of „non-user‟ under Section 47 of the 
Act. It has been  averred by the plaintiff in  paragraph 17 of the  plaint

that the plaintiff was not using the said trademark in India  at the time 
of filing of the present suit.  
IV. The rectification petiti ons have been filed by the defendants in 
November, 2014 and therefore, the relevant period of five years to be 
considered in terms of Section 47 (1) (b) of the Act would  commence 
from three months before the  date of filing of the aforesaid 
rectification petitions, i.e., August, 2009 to August, 2014. In the said 
period, the plaintiff has failed to give evidence of its user of the 
trademark BURGER KING in India. 
V.   The issues with regard to the invalidity of the plaintiff‟s trademarks 
arise out of the pleading s and therefore , the said issue has to be 
framed in terms of Order XIV of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(CPC) as well as Section 124 of the Act. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on the judgment in Abbott Healthcare (supra).  
VI. The judgments cited on beh alf of the plaintiff are distinguishable on 
facts and therefore, not applicable to the present case. 
8. I have heard the counsels for the parties. 
9. At the outset, a reference may be made to the relevant p ortion of 
Section 124 of the Act, which is set out below:  
“124. Stay of proceedings where the validity of registration 
of the trade mark is questioned, etc. —(1) Where in any suit 
for infringement of a trade mark—  
 
(a) the defendant pleads that registration of the plaintiff’s 
trade mark is invalid; or   
(b) th e defendant raises a defence under clause (e) of sub -
section (2) of section 30 and the plaintiff pleads the invalidity 
of registration of the defendant’s trade mark,

the court trying the suit (hereinafter referred to as the court), 
shall,—  
 
(i) if any p roceedings for rectification of the register in 
relation to the plaintiff’s or defendant’s trade mark are 
pending before the Registrar or the [High Court], stay the suit 
pending the final disposal of such proceedings;   
(ii) if no such proceedings are pend ing and the court is 
satisfied that the plea regarding the invalidity of the 
registration of the plaintiff’s or defendant’s trade mark is 
prima facie tenable , raise an issue regarding the same and 
adjourn the case for a period of three months from the date  
of the framing of the issue  in order to enable the party 
concerned to apply to the [High Court] for rectification of 
the register.   
(2) If the party concerned proves to the court that he has made 
any such application as is referred to in clause (b) (ii) of sub-
section (1) within the time specified therein or within such 
extended time as the court may for sufficient cause allow, the 
trial of the suit shall stand stayed until the final disposal of the 
rectification proceedings.” 
 
10. Sub clause (a) of Sub Section (1) of Section 124 of the Act deals with 
the situation where a defendant pleads that the registration of the plaintiff‟s 
trademark is invalid, as in the present case. Sub clause (b) (i) envisages a 
situation where the rectification proceedings are pendi ng on the date of 
filing of the suit, which is not the situation in the present case. Sub clause (b) 
(ii) deals with the situation where the rectification proceedings have been 
filed subsequent to the filing of the suit and therefore, this sub clause would  
be applicable in the present case as admittedly, the rectification proceedings 
were filed on behalf of the defendants after filing of the present suit. 
11. A perusal of sub clause (b) (ii) of Section 124(1) of the Act shows that 
the Court has to be satisfied that the plea regarding the invalidity of

registration of the trademark is prima facie  tenable. Thereupon, the Court 
may raise an issue regarding the same and adjourn the case for a period of 
three months from the date of framing of the said issue to enabl e the 
concerned party to apply for rectification of the register. It is significant to 
note that there is no “or” between the words “ prima facie tenable ” and 
“raise an issue regarding the same ”. In fact, the aforesaid phrases are 
separated by “,” which mea ns that the Court will proceed to frame the issue 
with regard to invalidity of the registration of the trademark only upon being 
satisfied that the plea of invalidity is prima facie  tenable. T hereupon, the 
defendant can file a rectification petition. 
12. I am in agreement with the submission of the plaintiff that the finding 
of prima facie  tenability is a statutory safeguard to ensure that the 
defendants do not file rectification proceedings as a counter blast to the 
infringement actions  against them, unless th eir plea of invalidity is prima 
facie tenable. If this were not so, the defendants would be permitted to 
challenge the registrations of the plaintiff by filing rectification petitions on 
frivolous and untenable grounds. It is f or this reason that the legislature has 
placed the safeguard of prima facie tenability in cases where the rectification 
proceedings are filed after a suit for infringement has been filed, whereas no 
such safeguard is there in cases where rectification proceedings have been 
filed before the suit. 
13. In Patel Field Marshal (supra), the Supreme Court observed that 
where a civil suit is pending, the jurisdiction can be exercised by a statutory 
authority only on account of finding of the Civil Court as regards the prima 
facie tenability of the plea of invalidity. It was further observed that such a 
finding is a basic requirement so that false, frivolous and untenable claims of

invalidity are not raised. 
14. In Abbott Healthcare (supra), relying upon Patel Field Marshal 
(supra), a Coordinate Bench o f this Court observed that mere pleading of 
invalidity of registration would not suffice and there is a further requirement 
under Section 124 of the Act that the party invoking Section 124 must 
satisfy the Court that the plea regarding invalidity of the re gistration of the 
mark is prima facie tenable and the Court raises an issue regarding the same. 
It was further observed that under Order XIV Rule 1 of the CPC, issues have 
to be framed on the basis of material propositions of fact or law and not on 
all propositions of fact or law raised in the pleadings. A reading of Section 
124 of the Act along with Order XIV Rule 1 of CPC shows that an issue 
with regard to validity of the registration granted in favour of the plaintiff 
can only be framed, when the plea to  the said effect taken by the defendant 
is found prima facie tenable. Therefore, I do not find merit in the submission 
of the defendant that merely because pleadings have been made in the 
written statement with regard to invalidity of the plaintiff‟s trade mark, an 
issue has to be necessarily framed in this regard. 
15. In light of the principles of law elucidated in the aforesaid judgments, 
this Court would have  to examine whether the plea of invalidity raised on 
behalf of the defendants is prima facie tenable or not. 
16.  The first ground of invalidity taken by the defendant s is in terms of 
Sections 47(1)(b) and 47(3)  of the Act. For ease of reference, Sections 
47(1)(b) and 47(3) are set out below:

have been due to special circumstances in the trade, which 
includes restrictions on the use of the trade mark in India 
imposed by any law or regulation and n ot to any intention to 
abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods 
or services to which the application relates.” 
 
17. Section 47(1)(b) of the Act provides that a registered trademark may 
be removed from the register of trademarks if up to a date of three months 
before the date of cancellation application, a continuous period of five years 
or longer has elapsed from the date on which the trademark was entered in 
the register and during which period , there was no bonafide use of the mark 
by the registered proprietor  in relation to the said goods . Section 47(3) 
contains an exception to Section 47(1)(b) and provides that if the „non -use‟ 
of a trademark is on account of special circumstances and not on account of 
intention to abandon or not to use the trademark, the provisions of Section 
47(1)(b) will not apply.

18. The aforesaid provisions were considered by the Supreme Court in 
Hardie (supra) in the context of Section s 46(1)(b)1 and 46(3)2 of the 
Trademark Act, 1958 (hereinafter „old Act‟), which is pari materia with the 
provisions of Section 47(1)(b) and Section 47(3) of the present Act.  In 
Hardie (supra), r elying upon the definition of „ bona fide use thereof in 
relation to those goods” in Section 2(2)(b) of the old Act, it was observed by 
the Supreme Court that the „use‟ may be other than physical and it need not 
be confined to use of the goods or sale of the goods bearing the trademark. It 
was held that the word „use‟ in Section 46(1)(b) of the old Act may include 
actions other than the actual sale o f the goods bearing the trademark in 
question in the market. Taking note of the words „any’ and „whatsoever’ 
qualifying the words “other relation” in Section 2(2)(b) of the old Act, it was 
held that the aforesaid words give a wider meaning to the words “ot her

relation”. Section 2(2)(b) 3 of the old Act is pari materia with Section 
2(2)(c)4 of the present Act. 
19. It was further held in Hardie (supra) that the intention to abandon 
could not be limited to „special circumstances of the trade‟. The intention to 
abandon is an essential component of „non-use‟ for the purpose s of Section 
46(1)(b) of the old Act . Therefore, it has to be proved that there was an 
intention to either abandon or not to use the trademark. 
20. In Express Bottlers (supra), it was held by the Supreme Court that the 
„non-user‟ under Section 46(1)(b) of the Old Act has to be proved by the 
applicant. It was further held that the intention to abandon by the proprietor 
of the mark has to be proved by cogent evidence. To determine whether a 
mark has been a bandoned by the proprietor thereof, the surrounding 
circumstances have to be seen and until the intention to abandon  is 
established on account of surrounding circumstances, it cannot be stated that 
the proprietor has decided to abandon the trademark. 
21. In light of the above, it has to be examined whether there has been a 
„non-use‟ of the trademark by the plaintiff in the aforesaid period of five 
years or an intention to abandon the said trademark. To buttress his

submission that the trademark „BURGER KING‟ has been used by the 
plaintiff within the aforesaid period of five years and that there has been no 
intention to abandon the trademark, the counsel for the plaintiff has drawn  
attention of the Court to the following documents filed along with the plaint: 
i. Resolution of Board of Directors of plaintiff company passed in 
October, 2013 permitting the use of „BURGER KING‟ trademark as a 
part of the company to be incorporated in India. 
ii. Incorporation Certificate dated 11 th November, 2013 in the name of 
„BURGER KING P rivate Limited‟ to provide restaurant services in 
India. 
iii. Announcement dated 19th November, 2013 on the plaintiff‟s website 
that it is entering into a joint venture to  develop „BURGER KING‟ 
brand in India and set up BURGER KING Restaurants in India.  
iv. Various newspaper articles of November, 2013 with regard to 
plaintiffs entering into Indian market. 
22. Counsel for the defendants has placed reliance on paragraph 17 of the 
plaint to contend that the plaintiff had no intention to use the aforesaid 
trademark in Indi a at the time of filing of the present suit . Paragraph 17 of 
the plaint is set out below: 
“17. On account of the inclusion of 'beef in the Plaintiff’s 
burgers, (which in the Indian context would have previously 
made the conduct of the Plaintiff’s business unviable) the 
Plaintiff had not launched a BURGER KING restaurant in 
India. However, owing to globalization and transformation in 
the Indian development and consequent on conducting 
exhaustive feasibility studies which have indicated the 
readiness of the I ndian market for the Plaintiff’s world -
renowned restaurants, in 2013, the Plaintiff has entered into a 
Joint Venture with Everstone Group, a leading private equity

and real estate firm in India and South East Asia, to set up a 
supply chain in India and est ablish BURGER KING 
restaurants across the country.” 
 
23.  A reading of paragraph 17 of the plaint as a whole shows that  the 
plaintiff has stated that the plaintiff has not launched BURGER KING 
restaurant in India till date as plaintiff‟s burger s include beef. However, in 
the lat ter part of the said paragraph, it has been stated that on account of 
transformation of the Indian market, the plaintiff has set up a joint venture in 
India to establish BURGER KING restaurant s in India.  Therefore, the 
aforesaid paragraph cannot be read in a manner as sought to be read by the 
the defendant.   
24. In Radico Khaitan Ltd. v. M/s. Devans Modern Breweries Ltd., 2019 
SCC OnLine Del 7483, relying upon Hardie (supra), it was held that the 
pre-launch and preparatory activities before the launch of the product 
bearing the trademark would amount to „use‟ under the Act. In this case 
also, the plaintiff had entered into an agreement for supply of glass bottles in 
respect of its trademark and other preparatory work was also undertaken by 
the plaintiff in relation to the use of its trademark. 
25. Therefore, in light of the discussion above, I am satisfied that there 
was „bona fide use‟ on behalf of the plaintiff of the trademark „BURGER 
KING‟ in the relevant period  between August, 2009 and August, 2014 and 
there was no intention on behalf of the plaintiff to abandon the said 
trademark. It may be relevant to note that  as a consequence of the 
preparatory work carried out by the plaintiff,  the first BURGER KING 
restaurant was opened in India on 9th November, 2014 and as on date there 
are more than 300 BURGER KING Restaurants in India.

26. The other ground taken on behalf of the defendant s is that the 
trademark „BURGER KING‟ being generic and common to trade and hence, 
the same cannot be registered. To cou nter the aforesaid submission,  the 
counsel for the plaintiff has drawn attention  of the Court  to the trademark 
applications filed on behalf of the defendant s in respect of the trademark 
„BURGER KING‟ and its formative device marks. He submits that in light  
of the aforesaid, the defendants are estopped from taking the ground of „non-
registrability‟. 
27. In Indian Hotels (supra), following the judgment in Automatic 
Electric Limited v. R.K. Dhawan, (1999) 91 PTC 81,  the contention of the 
appellant of the trademark  „JIVA‟ being  descriptive and hence , non-
registerable, was rejected by the Court on the ground that the appellant itself 
had applied for registration of the mark „JIVA‟ as a trademark and therefore, 
it did not lie in the mouth of the appellant to say that the aforesaid mark was 
a generic expression.  
28. To the same effect is the finding of the Division Bench  of this Court  
in PEPS Industries (supra), wherei n it was observed that when the 
defendant has sought registration of the same mark as that of the plaintif f 
(‘NO TURN’ in the said case ), such a defendant is estopped from raising a 
question on the validity of the said mark on the ground of it being 
descriptive in nature. 
29. In Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. v. DWD Pharmaceuticals 
Ltd., 2022 SCC OnLine 4015, the contention of the plaintiff therein that the 
mark „ZEST‟ was being used by various third parties and hence, the same is 
a publici juris expression, was rejected by the Court on the ground that the 
plaintiff itself had sought and obtained registrations of the same mark and

therefore, it does not lie in the mouth of the plaintiff to state that the word 
„ZEST‟ is a publici juris or a generic expression. 
30. A perusal of the trademark applications of the defendants shows that 
the defendants have themselves sought for registration of the said marks and 
therefore, in light of the dicta of the aforesaid judgments, the defendants are 
estopped from taking a plea that the trademark BURGER KING is generic 
and common to trade. Therefore, reliance placed on behalf of the  defendants 
on National Bell (supra) is misplaced.  
31. In my view, the defendants have failed to place any material in 
support of their submission that the trademark „BURGER KING‟ is either 
generic or common to trad e. It cannot be denied that the plaintiff ha s used 
the trademark „BURGER KING‟ since 1954 and holds registrations for the 
said mark in over 122 countries including India.  The Division Bench of this 
Court in M.A.C Personal Care Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Laverana GMBH and 
Co. K.G. & Anr., 2016 SCC OnLine Del 530, observed that the registrations 
of the plaintiff in multiple jurisdictions create an even stronger presumption 
that the plaintiff ‟s trademark  has reputation in the market. It was further 
observed that if a trademark is registered in favour of the p laintiff in a 
jurisdiction abroad, the said fact suggests that the mark of the plaintiff is 
distinctive and hence, the same is capable of distinguishing the plaintiff‟s 
trademark from those of other businesses.  
32. In view of the discussion above, I am of the  considered view that the 
plea raised by the defendant with regard to the invalidity of registrations 
granted in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the trademark BURGER 
KING and other formative mark s, is prima facie  not tenable.  There is no 
reasonable p rospect of the defendants succeeding in the cancellation

1. The present petition is a civil original trademark rectifica tion petition 
and has been wrongly numbered as an appeal.  Accordingly, the Registry is 
directed to re -number the present petition as a civil original trademark 
rectification petition.   
2. The present petition has been filed seeking cancellation/removal of 
the impugned trademark ‘BAL BIHAR SUPER’  (word per se ), registered 
under no.4256368 in Class 34 in the name of the respondent no.1 , from the 
Register of Trade Marks. 
3. Briefly, the case set up in the petition is that the petitioner is engaged 
in the business of manufacturing and trading all kinds of unmanufactured

tobacco/tobacco since the year 1990.  The petitioner also has many 
registrations of the trademark/label ‘LAL BIHARI CHAAP’ in Class 34, 
details of which are given in paragraph 5 of the petition . All the aforesaid 
trademark registrations are valid and subsis ting. The petitioner owns the 
copyright of the artistic work in the ‘LAL BIHARI CHAAP’ labels.  
4. The petitioner has also filed its sales turnover in respect of its 
products from the financial year 1989-90 to 2020- 21. The turnover of the 
petitioner in the year 2007-08 was around Rs.11,300/-, whereas the turnover 
in the financial year 2020 -21 was around Rs.1,82,45,136. It is claimed that 
approximately 85% of the turnover is from the mark ‘LAL BIHARI 
CHAAP’.  
5. Sometime in September, 2018 the petitioner came across tobacco 
products bearing the trade mark ‘LAL BAHAR CHH AAP’, being 
manufactured by M/s Shriram Maurya Enterprise. On inquiry it came to 
know that one Mr. Raghupati Maurya  was selling the tobacco p roducts 
under a deceptively similar trademark, packaging/trade dress and has also 
applied for the registration of said trademark/label ‘LAL BAHAR 
CHHAAP’ with the Trade mark Registry under application n o.3822767 
dated 3rd May, 2018, on a proposed to be used  basis. The petitioner opposed 
the registration of the aforesaid mark by filing opposition on 16 th October, 
2018, which was not contested by Mr. Raghupati Maurya  and therefore , 
resulted in the abandonment of his application. 
6. Thereafter, the petitioner made  a complaint through his dealer, Mr. 
Sushil Gupta at Uttam Nagar Police Station and the matter was amicably 
compromised by Mr. Raghupati Maurya due to the intervention of a local 
police. Mr. Raghupati Maurya admitted to using the trademark similar to the

petitioner's trademark/label ‘LAL BIHARI CHAAP’ and on 28th September, 
2018 gave an undertaking to not manufacture and/or sell the tobacco 
products bearing a similar trade mark/trade dress as that of the petitioner. 
Mr. Raghupati Maurya also willingly hande d over the infringing goods and 
labels available at the premises over to the dealer of the petitioner. 
7. On 10 th October, 2018,  not even two weeks after giving the said 
undertaking, Mr. Raghupati Maurya filed yet another similar trademark 
application for trademark/label ‘BAL BAHAR CHHAP GOLD ’ on a 
proposed to be used basis, which was again opposed by the petitioner and is 
pending before the Trade Marks Registry. 
8. Sometime in April 2021, the petitioner came across the application 
no.4777955 of the respondent no.1, Mrs. Meera Devi, who is the wife of Mr. 
Raghupati Maurya for registration of the trademark ‘BAL BIHARI SUPER’ 
(device) claiming user since 5 th August, 2019 . The petitioner opposed the 
registration of the aforesaid trademark by filing opposition on 27 th April, 
2021.  
9. The aforesaid application was associated with the word mark ‘BAL 
BIHARI SUPER’ registered under application no.4256368 dated 5th August, 
2019 in the name of the respondent no.1, on a proposed to be used basis.  
10. Accordingly, the petitioner has filed the present petition.  
PROCEEDINGS IN THE CASE 
11. Notice in the petition was issued on 8th February, 2022.  
12. The order dated 9 th November, 2022 passed by the Joint Registrar 
records that the respondent no.1 refused to receive the notice issued and 
hence, the respondent no.1 was deemed to have been served. None appeared 
on behalf of the respondent no.1 on 22nd December, 2022 and 27th February,

2023 also. Despite granting an opportunity to file reply, the respondent no.1 
has failed to rebut the case of th e petitioner. It is indicative of the fact that 
the respondent no.1 has nothing substantial to urge, by way of a response to 
the averments in the petition. 
ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 
13. I have heard the counsel for the petitioner and perused the  record of 
the case.  
14. From the facts detailed above, it is evident that Mr. Raghupati Maurya 
and Mrs. Meera Devi (respondent no.1), who are husband and wife , are 
colluding with each other. Together, both of them have filed four trademark 
applications which are similar to the  registered trademarks of the petitioner. 
Three of the aforesaid applications have been filed after acknowledging the 
rights of the petitioner and giving an undertaking to not use the trademark 
‘LAL BIHARI CHAAP’ or other similar marks. In order to get over the said 
undertaking, Mr. Raghupati Maurya started filing applications in the name 
of his wife, the respondent no.1. 
15. The adoption and the use of the impugned mark ‘BAL BIHARI 
SUPER’ by the respondent no.1 , which is very similar to the trademark 
‘LAL BIHARI CHAAP’ of the petitioner, is likely to create confusion in the 
market. Not only is the trademark of the respondent no.1 similar to the 
trademark of the plaintiff but the nature of the goods of the petitioner and 
the respondent no.1 are identical i.e., tobacco related products  falling in 
Class 34.  It is clear that the adoption of the said mark by the respondent 
no.1 is with the sole purpose of trading upon the goodwill and reputation of 
the petitioner. The mark of the respondent no.1 is also likely to de ceive 
unwary consumers of their association with the petitioner. Therefore, the

aforesaid registration in favour of the respondent no.1 could not have been 
granted in terms of Section 11 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter 
‘the Act’) 
16. The adoption of the trademark ‘BAL BIIHARI SUPER’ by the 
respondent no.1 is dishonest, as is evident from the acknowledgment of the 
petitioner’s right in the trademark/label ‘LAL BIHARI CHAAP’  by the 
husband of the respondent no.1  and an undertaking to not use marks simil ar 
to those of the petitioner. Therefore, the respondent no.1 is not entitled to the 
benefit of Section 12 of the Act.  
17. The petitioner is the prior adopter and continuous and exclusive user 
of the said trademark in respect of unmanufactured tobacco/tobacco  since 
12th February, 1990.  Therefore, the trademark registered in favour of the 
respondent no.1 is liable to be cancelled in terms of Section 57 of the Act. 
18. The impugned registration under no.4256368 in Class 34 remains on 
the Register of Trade Marks without sufficient cause.  
19. Accordingly, the present petition is allowed and the trademark 
registered under application no.4256368 in the name of the respondent no.1 
in Class 34 is removed from the Register of Trade Marks.   
20. Pending application also stands disposed of.    
21. The Registry is directed to supply a copy of the present order to the 
Trademark Registry, at e-mail - llc-ipo@gov.in for compliance.

Case set up by the petitioner 
2. The case set up by the petitioner in the petition is as follows:  
2.1 The petitioner, Dorco Co . Ltd., is engaged in the business of  
manufacturing and exporting  grooming products such as shaving 
razors, blades, kitchen knives and stationery cutters since 1955. The 
petitioner is Asia's market leader  in respect of razors, razor blades, 
kitchen knives and stationery cutters etc. The petitioner  is widely 
recognized around the world for introducing the world‟s first 7-blade 
shaving system . The products of the petitioner are sold in 120 
countries around the world.  
2.2 The petitioner derived the trademark DORC O from the name of its 
company, Dorco Co. Ltd., and has used the said trademark in different 
parts of the world since 1964  and in India since 1994. The petitioner 
is the registered proprietor of the trademark DORCO in India in 
various classes, since 1994  and obtained the first registration of the 
aforesaid trademark on  30th November, 1994 in India . Details of the

2.5 The petitioner has also been featured in popular trade magazines and 
newspapers with circulation in India . The petitioner has a strong 
presence on social networking sites such as Twitter,  Instagram and 
Facebook. 
2.6 The respondent no.1 is the partnership firm of one Mr Govind Prasad 
Bagaria and Ms . Rakhi Sureka .  The respondent no.1 got the 
trademark DORCO/ 
  (hereinafter „impugned 
trademark‟) registered vide registration no.1252224  in respect of 
razors and razor blades in class 8 in India.  The application  for 
registration of the impugned trademark  was filed on 28th November, 
2003 claiming use since 1st April, 2001.  
2.7 The respondent no.1 has not used the registered trademark upto three 
months before the date of the present rectification petition,  for a 
continuous period of five years from the date of registration , in 
relation to the goods for which  the registration was granted . 
Therefore, it is liable to be removed for „non-use‟ in terms of Section 
47(1)(b) of the Act. 
2.8 The registration  of the impugned trademark  is obtained by the 
respondent no.1 in collusion with the petitioner‟s distributor in Nepal, 
Mr. Pramod Sureka, with the dishonest and mala fide intention to ride 
on the goodwill of the petitioner . Hence, the same is liable to be 
rectified under Sec 57 (2) of the Act. 
2.9 Vide email dated 27 th July, 2016, Mr. Pramod Sureka informed the 
petitioner that Govind Prasad Bagaria was well aware of the ri ghts

formative marks. However, he demanded Rs. 15,00,000/- to assign the 
impugned trademark back to the petitioner. 
2.10 The partners of respondent no.1 have also applied for registration of 
the trademarks of other international brands such as  “Anfanna” and  
“Tarzan Boy ”. Hence, the partners of respondent no.1 are  habitual 
trademark squatters and serial infringers. 
2.11 Accordingly, the present petition has been filed by the petitioner.  
Proceedings in the suit 
3. Notice in the present petition was issued by the Intellectual Property 
Appellate Board (IPAB) on 18 th January, 2018. However, the respondent 
no.1 failed to appear before IPAB despite service. Thereafter, the present 
rectification got transferred to  this Court after coming into effect of 
Tribunals Reforms Act, 2022 and the Court notice was issued to the 
respondent no.1 by this Court on 25 th January, 2022. It is noted in the order 
dated 6th October, 2022 that the respondent no.1 refused to accept notice and 
that the same amounted to service.  
4. Subsequently, an application for substituted service was fil ed by the 
petitioner and the same was allowed and the respondent no.1 was directed to 
be served by way of publication. The affidavit of service has been filed on 
behalf of the p etitioner and the same is taken on record. Therefore, the 
respondent no.1 is deemed to have been  served. None has appeared on 
behalf of the respondent no.1, nor any reply/counter-statement has been filed 
on behalf of the respondent no.1. It is indicative of the fact that the 
respondent no.1 has nothing substantial to put forth on merits, by way of a 
response to the averments made in the petition.

Analysis and Findings 
5.  I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the record of the 
case.  
6.  In order to determine whether the trademark of the respondent no.1 is 
identical to the trademark of the petitioner, it would be apposite to refer to 
the two competing trademarks, as set out below:  
Petitoner‟s Trademarks Defendant‟s Trademarks 
 
  
7. The impugned trademark was applied for registration by the 
respondent no.1 claiming user since 1st April, 2001. However, upto a date of 
three months before filing the present rectification petition, a period of five 
years have elapsed from the date of registration of the impugned trademark, 
during which there has been no bonafide use of the impugned trademark in 
relation to the goods for which the registration was granted.  
8. In the judgment in Shell Transource Limited v. Shell International 
Petroleum Company Ltd. ¸ 2012 SCC IPAB 29, it was observed by the 
IPAB that the onus of proving “non -user” is on the person who pleads the 
same. However, when the applicant pleads “non -user”, the respondent must 
specifically deny it. Therefore, in the absence of a specific denial, it was 
held that the allegations of “non-user” stood admitted.  
9. In the present case,  the allegations of “non -user” against the 
respondent no.1 stand admitted in the absence of a specific denial of the 
same and the impugned trademark is liable to be removed from the Register

of Trade  Marks on account of “non-user” as contemplated under Section 
47(1)(b) of the Act.  
10. From the facts detailed above, it is clear that the petitioner is the 
proprietor of the impugned trademark. T he respondent no.1 cannot claim to 
be the proprietor of the impugned trademark  as there is nothing to show as 
to how the impugned trademark has been adopted by the respondent no.1. 
Therefore, the application for registration of the impugned trademark is in 
contravention of  Section 18 (1) of the Act. In fact, t he registration of the 
petitioner‟s identical mark in respect of similar goods, was pending  in India 
and was also cited as a conflicting mark in the examination report issued in 
the application for registration of the impugned trade mark. Therefore, as per 
Sections 9(1)(a) and 11(1)(a) of the Act , the registration of the impugned 
trademark could not be granted. 
11. The registration of the impugned trademark is also in contravention of 
Section 11(3)(b) of the Act, as its use would be prevented in India by virtue 
of the law of copyright, as the petitioner is the original owner of copyright in 
the impugned trademark , which is also registered as a trademark in its  
favour in Korea since 2002 and thereafter, in Turkey, China and Ukraine. 
12. The grant of registration of the impugned trademark by the respondent 
no.2 is against the principles of Section 11(3)(a) of the Act , as there is no 
dispute that the petitioner is the prior user of the impugned trademark since 
1994 in India  and acros s the world since 1964 . Due to such a long, 
continuous and extensive use, the impugned trademark is solely associated  
with the petitioner. Therefore, t he registration of the impugned trademark 
should have been refused by the respondent no.2.

13. In view of the  discussion above , it is clear that the impugned 
trademark has been adopted by the respondent no.1 dishonestly to trade 
upon the established goodwill and reputation of the petitioner and to project 
itself to be associated with the petitioner.  The nature of  the impugned 
trademark is such that it will deceive the public and create confusion as 
regards the source of the goods manufactured and sold under the impugned 
trademark.  
14. Accordingly, the present petition is allowed and the impugned 
trademark registered under trademark application no.1252224 in the name of 
the respondent no.1 in Class 8 is removed from the Register of Trade Marks.  
15.  A copy of the order be sent to the respondent s through e-mail. The 
Registry is directed to supply a copy of the present orde r to the  Trademark 
Registry, at e-mail - llc-ipo@gov.in for compliance.

I.A. 4831/2022(of the respondent no.1 u/s 151 of CPC) 
1. The present rectification petition has been filed on behalf of the 
petitioner for rectificatio n of the trademark register qua trademark 
registration no.1252812, which is registered in class 99 (classes 38 and 41) 
in favour of the respondent no.1 since 2nd December, 2003.

no.1 seeking dismissal of the aforesaid rectification petition.

been filed on behalf of the respondent no.1. Rejoinder thereto has also been 
filed on behalf of the respondent no.1.  
4. Counsel for the respondent no.1 submits that the petitioner was aware 
of the registration in favour of the respondent no.1 as far back as on 6th June, 
2018 and despite a suit, being CS(COMM) 253/2019, having been  filed by 
the petitioner against the respondent  no.1 on 10th May, 2019, the petitioner 
took no steps to have a preliminary issue framed on the alleged invalidity of 
the respondent no.1’s trademark . Therefore, in view of the judgment of the 
Supreme Court in Patel Field Marshal Agencies and Anr. v. P.M. Diesels 
Limited and Ors. , (2018) 2 SCC 112 , followed by a Coordinate Bench of 
this Court in Resilient Innovations Pvt. Ltd. v. Phonepe Private Limited & 
Anr., (2021) 88 PTC 610, the present rectification petition filed on behalf of 
the petitioner is not maintainable.  
5. Counsel for the respondent no.1 has placed reliance on the pleadings 
in the aforesaid suit to submit that the mark in respect of which rectification 
is sought by the petitioner herein , was subject matter of the aforesaid suit . 
Therefore, in terms of S ection 124 read with Section 30(2)(e) of the Trade 
Marks Act, 1999, a preliminary issue would be required to be framed in the 
aforesaid suit before a rectification application can be filed.  
6. Per contra, the counsel for the petitioner submits that the impug ned 
trademark registration, which is the subject matter of the rectification 
petition, is not in issue in CS(COMM) 253/2019. In the said suit, the 
petitioner has claimed propr ietary rights over the trademark “NOW” and 
“NOW” formative marks including “ENOW”.  Reference is this regard has 
been made to paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 of the plaint in 
CS(COMM)253/2019. Hence, t he petitioner herein has sought injunction

against the respondent no.1 using the trademarks “E! NOW” and “E! NEWS 
NOW”. Therefore, it is submit ted that the judgments relied upon by the 
respondent no.1 are not applicable in the facts of the present case. 
7. I have heard the counsels for the parties. 
8. Section 30(2)(e) and Section 124(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 are 
set out hereunder:  
―30. Limits on effect of registered trade  mark. –  
 2… A registered trade mark is not infringed where— 
(e) the use of a registered trade mark, being one of two or more 
trade marks registered under this Act which are identical or nearly 
resemble each other, in exercise  of the right to the use of that trade 
mark given by registration under this Act.‖ 
… 
―124. Stay of proceedings where the validity of registration of the 
trade mark is questioned, etc.— 
(1) Where in any suit for infringement of a trade mark— 
(a) the defendant pleads that registration of the plaintiff‘s trade mark 
is invalid; or 
(b) the defendant raises a defence under clause (e) of sub-section (2) 
of section 30 and the plaintiff pleads the invalidity of registration of 
the defendant’s trade mark,  
the court trying the suit (hereinafter referred to as the court), shall,— 
(i) if any proceedings for rectification of the register in relation to the 
plaintiff‘s or defendant‘s trade mark are pending before the Registrar 
or the Appellate Board, stay the suit pending the final disposal of such 
proceedings; 
(ii) if no such proceedings are pending and the court is satisfied that 
the plea regarding the invalidity of the registration of the plaintiff’s 
or defendant’s trade mark is prima facie tenable, raise an issue 
regarding the same and adjourn the case for a period of three 
months from the date of the framing of the issue in order to enable 
the party concerned to apply to the Appellate Board for rectification 
of the register.‖

relevant paragraphs of the plaint in CS(COMM) 253/2019: 
―3. That the alleged usage of the marks ‗E! NOW‘ and ‗E News 
NOW‘ is a spurious and malafide besides being an afterthought done 
simply to defeat the rights vested by the Plaintiff in using the mark 
and Logo of ‗NOW‘. 
4… 
(iv) That on 10.10.2018, the Defendant Company filed the evidence 
in support of opposition under Rule 45 in Trade mark Application No. 
3679905 and for the first time claimed its right over the mark E ! 
NEWS NOW only and not E Now.‖ 
 
10. From a reading of the plaint as a whole it emerges that the cause of 
action for filing the aforesaid suit by the petitioner herein was on account of 
respondent no.1 ascertaining rights over the marks “E! NOW” and “E 
NEWS NO W”. In the prayer clause, a decree of permanent injunction is 
sought against the respondent no.1  herein from using the channel/domain 
“E! NOW” and “E! NEWS NOW”, which is deceptively similar to 
petitioner’s mark “E NOW”. There is no pleading in the  plaint with regard 
to the mark “
 /E!”  and no injunction has been sought against the said 
mark. Therefore, the mark  “
 /E!” is the not the subject matter of  the 
aforesaid suit. 
11. In the written statement filed on behalf of the respondent  no.1 herein 
in the aforesaid suit, the respondent no.1 has pleaded the registration of the 
mark “
 /E!”, which is the subject matter of the present rectification 
petition. However, the aforesaid pleading in the written statement has not 
been raised as a defence  to the cause of action pleaded in the plaint  in the

aforesaid suit . In view of the aforesaid pleading  made in the written 
statement filed on behalf of the respondent  no.1 herein, the petitioner herein 
has rebutted the same in its replication.  Merely because the respondent no.1 
herein has pleaded in its written statement the fact of registration being 
granted in its favour in respect of the mark  “
 /E!”, would not expand the 
scope of the aforesaid suit. Admittedly, the respondent no.1 has not filed any 
suit seeking to restrain the petitioner herein from using the said mark. 
12. A reading of the written statement filed on behalf of the respondent 
no.1 herein in the aforesaid suit shows that no defence has been raised by the 
respondent no.1 herein in terms of Section 30(2)(e) of the Trade  Marks Act, 
1999. The respondent no.1 has not pleaded  that the registered marks of the 
plaintiff are identical to the mark “
  /E!” or nearly resemble each other.  
Therefore, Section 124 (1) (b) of the Trade Marks Act , 1999 is not attracted 
in the present case. It is not the case of the respondent no.1 that the provision 
of Section 124 (1) (a) is attracted in the present case. 
13. Counsel for the respondent no.1 has relied upon paragraphs 31 and 32 
of the judgment in Patel Field Marshal Agencies (supra). The same are set 
out below: 
―31.  Rather, from the résumé of the provisions of the 1958 Act made 
above, it becomes clear that all questions with regard to the validity 
of a trade mark is required to be decided by the Registrar or the High 
Court under the 1958 Act or by the Registrar or the IPAB under the 
1999 Act and not by the civil court. The civil court, in fact, is not 
empowered by the Act to decide the said question. Furthermore, the 
Act mandates that the decisions rendered by the prescribed statutory

authority [Registrar/High Court (now IPAB)] will bind the civil court. 
At the same time, the Act (both old and new) goes on to provide a 
different procedure to govern the exercise of the same jurisdiction in 
two different situations. In a case where the issue of i nvalidity is 
raised or arises independent of a suit, the prescribed statutory 
authority will be the sole authority to deal with the matter. However, 
in a situation where a suit is pending (whether instituted before or 
after the filing of a rectification ap plication) the exercise of 
jurisdiction by the prescribed statutory authority is contingent on a 
finding of the civil court as regards the prima facie tenability of the 
plea of invalidity. 
32.  Conversely, in a situation where the civil court does not find  a 
triable issue on the plea of invalidity the remedy of an aggrieved party 
would not be to move under Sections 46/56 of the 1958 Act but to 
challenge the order of the civil court in appeal. This would be 
necessary to avoid multiple proceedings on the same  issue and 
resultant conflict of decisions.‖ 
 
14. In the aforesaid judgment, relied upon by the respondent  no.1, the 
defendants had  contested the validity of the plaintiffs ’ trade mark “Field 
Marshal” in their written statement  and claimed that the same was li able to 
be rectified by the Trademark Registry. Similarly, in Resilient Innovations 
Pvt. Ltd. (supra), in the written statement filed on behalf of the petitioner 
therein (the defendant in the suit between the parties), it was pleaded that the 
registration in favour of the plaintiff therein was invalid. Therefore, t he 
aforesaid cases were covered under Section 124  (1) (a) of the Trade Marks 
Act, 1999, which is not the case  of the respondent no.1  here. Hence, the 
aforesaid judgments would not come to the aid of the respondent no.1.  
15. In my considered view, the mark “
 /E!”, which is the subject 
matter of the present rectification petition, is not the subject matter of

CS(COMM)253/2019. In fact, the cause of action for filing the present 
rectification petition was on account of the petitioner coming to know that 
the respondent no.1 has claimed exclusive proprietary right s over the mark 
“
 /E!”, when the respondent  no.1 issued notices of opposition on 11 th 
April, 2018 against the petitioner’s applications for regist ration of its 
trademarks.   
16. In view of the aforesai d discussion, Section 124 of the Trademarks 
Act, 1999 would not apply in the present case. T here is no merit in the 
present application and the same is dismissed.

non-admissibility of the present rectification petition as pleaded in I .A. 
4831/2022 is decided.

19. Counsel for the petitioner opposes the present application. He submits 
that the present application has been filed in a malafide manner , only to 
delay the proceedings in the present rectification petition.

Limited, bearing registration no. 1483826 and 1483827 in Class es 36 
and 37 of the Act. Several other registrations have also been obtained 
by the petitioner in respect of the mark ALPHA and its formative 
marks. The earliest registration was granted on 1st September, 2006.  
2.3 The petitioner has successfully delivered several real estate projects 
under the mark ALPHA, such as Alpha International City, Karnal 
(Haryana), Alpha International City, Fatehabad (Haryana) , 
GurgaonOne-84 among others.  
2.4 The petitioner has also won several real estate awards and accolades 
over the years. Due to long and extensive use  of the mark ALPHA, 
the petitioner has acquired vast goodwill and reputation. The annual 
sales of the petitioner in the year 2018 amounted to Rs. 988,145,000/- 
and the petitioner has also incurred expenditure  of Rs.6,241,00 0/- 
towards advertisement and promotions in the said year.  
2.5 The respondent no.1 has obtained registration of the mark 
  
(hereinafter ‘impugned mark’ ) in respect of similar services as that of 
the petitioner, in the name of the respondent no.1 under application 
no. 3187803 in Class 36 of the Act. The letter 'A' and the word  
ALPHA in the impugned mark are written in black colour , which 
shows the intention of the respondent no. 1 to give prominence to the 
mark ALPHA in the impugned mark. The colour scheme adopted by 
the respondent no.1 for the impugned mark is also similar to that of 
the petitioner’s ALPHA marks.

2.6 The malafides of the respondent no.l is evident from the fact that the 
respondent no.l company was incorporated by the ex-employees of 
the petitioner and its subsidiary  company, Alpha G: Corp 
Management Services Pvt. Ltd.,  on 23rd July, 2015, which is prior to 
the date of resignation of the said employees. The said employees had 
complete access to the records and data of the petitioner  and its 
subsidiary company. 
2.7 Public caution notices were published by the petitioner's subsidiary 
company in various newspapers  when it came to know that its ex -
employees had incorporated a new company with confusingly similar 
name for providing identical services of facility management . 
Thereafter, the respondent no.1 filed a defamation complaint before 
Tis Hazari Courts, New Delhi. Against the summoning order d ated 
14th May, 2016 passed in the aforementioned defamation complaint, 
the petitioner filed a CRL.M.C. No.297/2017 before this Court, which 
is pending adjudication.  
2.8 The petitioner filed an application being SRN G43969063 dated 6 th 
February, 2017 before Mi nistry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) under 
Section 16 of the Companies Act, 2013 seeking a direction to the 
respondent no. 1 to rectify its deceptively similar/identical trade 
name. The Regional Director, MCA held that the trade name of the 
respondent no.1 closely resembles the name of the subsidiary 
company of the petitioner and directed them to change the name of 
their company vide order dated 1st August, 2017.  
2.9 The impugned mark was published in the Trade Mark Journal on 18 th 
September, 2017. However, the r espondent no. 1 concealed the

factum of passing of the aforementioned order by the Regional 
Director regarding change of name of the respondent no.1 company. 
2.10 The respondent no.l has challenged the aforesaid order of the 
Regional Director by filing a Writ  Petition Civil No. 24380/2017 
before High Court of Punjab and Haryana, which is presently pending 
adjudication. However, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana vide 
order dated 30 th October, 2017 has stayed the operation of the order 
dated 1st August, 2017 passed by the Regional Director. 
2.11 The impugned mark has been adopted by the respondent no. 1 with 
the sole intention of riding on the goodwill of the petitioner and to 
create confusion in the minds of the public and trade channel. 
2.12 Accordingly, the present rectification has been filed by the petitioner.  
Proceedings in the petition 
3.  Notice in the present petition was issued by the Intellectual Property 
Appellate Board (IPAB) on 1st November, 2018. However, the respondent 
no.1 failed to appear before IPAB despit e service. The respondent no.1 was 
proceeded against ex parte on 21 st January, 2020. Thereafter, the present 
rectification got transferred to this Court after coming into effect of 
Tribunals Reforms Act, 2022 and the Court notice was issued to the 
respondent no.1 by this Court on 28th March, 2022. However, none appeared 
on behalf of the respondent no.1 despite service. 
4. It was noted in the order dated 23 rd January, 2023 that the respondent 
no.1 has changed its corporate name from ‘Alpha Integrated Management  
Service Private Limited to ‘Abante Integrated Management Services Private 
Limited’. Further, on 15th February, 2023 , the counsel for the petitioner

respondent no.1 in respect of the marks

and ‘ABANTE’ (word) . The court notice was also issued to the respondent 
no.1 including through attorney, who applied for the  aforesaid registrations 
on his behalf on the said date. Court notice was duly served on the 
respondent no.1’s attorney. Despite service, none has appeared on behalf of 
the respondent no.1 . N or any reply/counter -statement has been filed on 
behalf of the respondent no.1. It is indicative of the fact that the respondent 
no.1 is not interested in pursuing the present petition, as it has already 
changed its trademark and its corporate name.  
Analysis and Findings 
5.  I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the record of the 
case.  
6.  In order to determine whether the trademark of the respondent no.1 is 
identical to the trademark of the petitioner, it would be apposite to refer to 
the two competing trademarks, as set out below:  
Respondent no.1’s Trademark Petitioner’s Trademarks 
 
  ALPHA

7. It is pertinent to note that the prominent and essential feature of the 
impugned mark is ‘ALPHA’, which is identical and deceptively similar to 
the petitioner's mark ‘ALPHA’ and its other formative marks  in respect of 
similar services. Therefore, the registration of the impugned mark is in 
contravention of Section 11(1) of the Act.  
8. The respondent no. 1 was well aware of the petitioner's mark  ALPHA 
since respondent no. 1 was incorporated by ex -employees of the petitioner. 
There can be no plausible reason for the respondent no. 1 to have chosen an 
identical and a deceptively similar mark as that of the petitioner's mark for 
identical goods. Clearly, the adoption of the mark by the respondent no.1 is 
dishonest and therefore, the respondent no.1 is not entitled to the benefit of 
Section 12 of the Act.  
9. From the facts detaile d above, it is clear that the petitioner is the 
proprietor of the impugned mark. The respondent no.1 cannot claim to be 
the proprietor of the impugned trademark as there is nothing to show as to 
how the impugned trademark has been adopted by the respondent  no.1. 
Therefore, the application for registration of the impugned trademark is in 
contravention of Section 18(1) of the Act. Further, the respondent no.1 is 
also not entitled to the benefit of Section 11(4) of the Act as the petitioner 
has not consented to the use of the impugned mark by the respondent no.1. 
10. The grant of registration of the impugned trademark by the respondent 
no.2 is against the principles of Section 11(3)(a) of the Act, as there is no 
dispute that the petitioner is the prior user of the impugned trademark since 
2003 in India. Due to such a long, continuous and extensive use, the 
impugned mark is solely associated with the petitioner. Therefore, the

registration of the impugned trademark should have been refused by the 
respondent no.2. 
11. In view of the discussion above, it is clear that the impugned 
trademark has been adopted by the respondent no.1 dishonestly to trade 
upon the established goodwill and reputation of the petitioner and to project 
itself to be associated with the petitioner. The nature of the impugned 
trademark is such that it will deceive the public and create confusion as 
regards the source of the goods manufactured and sold under the impugned 
trademark.  
12. Accordingly, the present petition is allowed and the impugned 
trademark registered under trademark  application no. 3187803 in the name 
of the respondent no.1 in Class 36 is removed from the Register of Trade  
Marks.  
13.  A copy of the order be sent to the respondent s through e-mail. The 
Registry is directed to supply a copy of the  present order to the  Trademark 
Registry, at e-mail - llc-ipo@gov.in for compliance.
